During her adventures in the bazaars of Tunisia, Maya chose to stay in a luxury riad. It charged \(2,500\) Tunisian dinars per night. Given that she lodged there for four nights and her credit card only allows a maximum transaction of \( \$250\) at once, how many times must Maya swipe her card to settle her bill? (Note: \(1\) Tunisian dinar \(= \$0.35\))

}\SetValue{Solution}{%

Maya stayed in a luxury riad in Tunisia that cost 2,500 Tunisian dinars per night. She stayed for four nights, and her credit card allows a maximum transaction of \$250 per swipe. We need to find how many times she must swipe her card to pay the total bill. 

\begin{alignat*}{2}
\text{Total cost in TND} &= 2,500 \times 4 \quad && \{ \text{Multiply by the number of nights} \} \\
&= 10,000 \, \text{TND} \\
\text{Total cost in USD} &= 10,000 \times 0.35 \quad && \{ \text{Convert TND to USD} \} \\
&= 3,500 \, \text{USD} \\
\text{Number of swipes} &= \frac{3,500}{250} \quad && \{ \text{Divide by the per-swipe limit} \} \\
&= 14
\end{alignat*}

Thus, Maya must swipe her card 14 times to settle her bill.

The correct answer is: $\fbox{C) $14$}$.

%\boxed{\text{C) }14.}
