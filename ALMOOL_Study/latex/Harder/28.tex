$$ R=300(1.007)^{\tfrac{s}{4}} $$ How can the formula above be used to predict the revenue, in thousands of dollars, of a startup company $s$ quarters after its inception? According to the prediction, the revenue is expected to rise by $0.7 \%$ every $s$ quarters. What is the value of $s$ ?

### Step 1: Understanding the formula
The formula \( R = 300(1.007)^{\tfrac{s}{4}} \) models the exponential revenue growth of a startup. Here, \( R \) is the revenue in thousands of dollars, and \( 1.007 \) indicates a $0.7\%$ growth per quarter. We need to find the value of \( s \) that aligns with this growth rate.

### Step 2: Setting up the equation
Since the revenue is said to rise by $0.7\%$ every \( s \) quarters, we want to find \( s \) for which:
\[
(1.007)^{\frac{s}{4}} = 1.007.
\]

### Step 3: Solving for \( s \)
\begin{alignat*}{2}
(1.007)^{\frac{s}{4}} &= 1.007 \qquad && \{ \text{since } 1.007 = (1.007)^1 \} \\
\frac{s}{4} &= 1 \qquad && \{ \text{taking the exponent } \} \\
s &= 4 \qquad && \{ \text{multiplying both sides by 4} \}.
\end{alignat*}

### Conclusion
Thus, the revenue increases by 0.7\% every 4 quarters. Therefore, the value of \( s \) is $\fbox{C) $4$}$.
