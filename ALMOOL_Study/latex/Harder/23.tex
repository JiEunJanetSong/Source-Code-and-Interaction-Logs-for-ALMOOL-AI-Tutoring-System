}\SetValue{Solution}{%

### Step 1: Determine when the system has no solution
A system of linear equations has no solution if the lines are parallel, meaning the coefficients of \(a\) and \(b\) are proportional but the constant terms are not.

### Step 2: Set up the ratio of coefficients
From the given equations:
\[
4a - 3b = 7
\]
\[
da - 8b = 15
\]
For the lines to be parallel, the ratio of the coefficients of \(a\) and \(b\) must be equal:
\[
\frac{4}{d} = \frac{-3}{-8}
\]

### Step 3: Solve for \(d\)
\[
\frac{4}{d} = \frac{3}{8}
\]
Cross-multiply:
\[
4 \times 8 = 3 \times d
\]
\[
32 = 3d
\]
Divide by 3:
\[
d = \frac{32}{3}
\]

### Conclusion
The value of \(d\) that makes the system have no solution is: $\fbox{D) $\frac{32}{3}$}$
