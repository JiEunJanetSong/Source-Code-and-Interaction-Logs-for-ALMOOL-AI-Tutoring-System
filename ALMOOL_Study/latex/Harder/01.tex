During a drought, the average annual rainfall was at least 5 inches less than the normal average. If the average annual rainfall during the drought is $y$ inches and the normal average annual rainfall is $x$ inches, which of the following must be true?

\ansFOURsT{%start
	 	 $y=x-5$}{%<--- (A)
	 	 $y \leq x-5$}{%<--- (B)
	 	 $y \geq x-5$}{%<--- (C)
		 $y \leq x+5$}%<---- (D)

}\SetValue{Solution}{%

The problem states that during a drought, the average annual rainfall is at least 5 inches less than the normal average rainfall.\begin{alignat*}{2}
y &\leq x - 5 \qquad && \{\text{the drought rainfall is at least 5 inches less than the normal rainfall}\} 
\end{alignat*}
This inequality shows that the average rainfall during the drought is less than or equal to the normal average rainfall minus 5 inches. 
\begin{alignat*}{2}
	y &\neq x - 5 \qquad && \{\text{because the drought rainfall can be less than exactly 5 inches less}\} \\
	y &\geq x - 5 \qquad && \{\text{contradicts the condition of the rainfall being less than or equal to \( x - 5 \)}\} \\
	y &\leq x + 5 \qquad && \{\text{irrelevant to the problem statement of being at least 5 inches less}\}
\end{alignat*}
Thus, the correct answer is $\fbox{B) $y \leq x - 5 $}$.
