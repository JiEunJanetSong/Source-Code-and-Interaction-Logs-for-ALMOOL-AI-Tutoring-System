## Finding the percent increase in the cube's side length

To find the required percent increase in side length for the cube, we start by finding the side lengths of the original and new cubes.

### Step 1: Finding the original side length

The volume \( V \) of a cube is given by:
\[
V = s^3
\]
For the cube with a volume of 27 cubic inches:
\[
s^3 = 27
\]
\[
s = \sqrt[3]{27} = 3 \, \text{inches}
\]

### Step 2: Finding the new side length

For the cube with a volume of 64 cubic inches:
\[
s^3 = 64
\]
\[
s = \sqrt[3]{64} = 4 \, \text{inches}
\]

### Step 3: Calculating the percent increase

The increase in side length is:
\[
4 - 3 = 1 \, \text{inch}
\]
The percent increase is:
\[
\left( \frac{1}{3} \right) \times 100 = 33.33\%
\]

Thus, the correct answer is: $\fbox{B) $33\%$}$
