A local library donates $7$ of every $140$ donated books that it receives to a nearby school. If the library donated $28$ books to the school last week, how many books were donated to the library?

}\SetValue{Solution}{%

The library donates 7 books for every 140 books received. Given that 28 books were donated to the school, we need to find the total number of books donated to the library.

\begin{alignat*}{2}
\frac{7}{140} &= \frac{28}{x} \qquad && \{ \text{Setting up a proportion} \} \\
7x &= 140 \times 28 && \{ \text{Cross-multiply to solve for } x \} \\
7x &= 3920 && \{ \text{Calculate } 140 \times 28 \} \\
x &= \frac{3920}{7} && \{ \text{Divide both sides by 7} \} \\
x &= 560. && \{ \text{Final result} \}
\end{alignat*}

Thus, the total number of books donated to the library was $\fbox{C) $560$}$.
