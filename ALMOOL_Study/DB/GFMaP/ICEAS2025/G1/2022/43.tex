}\SetValue{Solution}{%

We have a sphere of radius $r$. Its volume $V$ and surface area $A$ are given by:

$$
V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3
\quad\text{and}\quad
A = 4\pi r^2.
$$

The problem states that the volume is numerically equal to four times the surface area:

$$
V = 4A.
$$

Hence,

$$
\frac{4}{3}\pi r^3 \;=\; 4\bigl(4\pi r^2\bigr).
$$

Simplify:

$$
\frac{4}{3}\pi r^3 
= 16\pi r^2.
$$

Divide both sides by $\pi r^2$ (assuming $r \neq 0$):

$$
\frac{4}{3}r = 16 
\quad\Longrightarrow\quad
r = \frac{16 \cdot 3}{4} = 12.
$$

Therefore, the radius of the sphere is $12$, and its diameter is $\boxed{24}$.
