Jamal has a drawer containing 6 green socks, 18 purple socks, and 12 orange socks. After adding more purple socks, Jamal noticed that there is now a $60 \%$ chance that a sock randomly selected from the drawer is purple. How many purple socks did Jamal add?

}\SetValue{Solution}{%

Answer (B): A 60\% chance of choosing a purple sock implies a 40\% chance of choosing a green or orange sock. It follows that the $6+12=18$ non-purple socks represent $40 \%$ of all the socks. This means that 9 socks represent $20 \%$ of the total, and 27 socks represent $60 \%$ of the total. Jamal therefore added $27-18=9$ purple socks to the drawer.

OR

Let $x$ equal the number of additional purple socks, increasing the number of purple socks to $18+x$ and the total number of socks to $36+x$. Because the proportion of purple socks must equal $60 \%$, the following equation must be satisfied:

$$
\frac{18+x}{36+x}=\frac{60}{100}=\frac{3}{5}
$$


Solving for $x$ yields

$$
\begin{aligned}
5(18+x) & =3(36+x) \\
90+5 x & =108+3 x \\
2 x & =18 \\
x & =9 .
\end{aligned}
$$


Jamal added 9 purple socks to the drawer.
