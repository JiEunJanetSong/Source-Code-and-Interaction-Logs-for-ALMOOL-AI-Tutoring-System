}\SetValue{Solution}{%

Each cup received one fifth of three fourths of the pitcher. This corresponds to a percentage of

$$
\frac{1}{5} \cdot \frac{3}{4}=\frac{3}{20}=\frac{15}{100}=15 \%
$$


OR

The juice filled up 75\% of the pitcher, so each of the 5 cups received

$$
\frac{1}{5} \cdot 75 \%=15 \%
$$
