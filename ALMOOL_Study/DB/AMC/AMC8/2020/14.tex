}\SetValue{Solution}{%

Answer (D): The total population of all the cities equals the number of cities multiplied by the average city population. There are 20 cities, and the dashed line shows that the average population is between 4500 and 5000. It follows that the total population of the 20 cities is between $20 \cdot 4500=$ 90,000 and $20 \cdot 5000=100,000$. Only choice (D) 95,000 is within 5000 of the actual total population.
