}\SetValue{Solution}{%


The recipe requires twice as much sugar as lemon juice, so Luka needs $2 \cdot 3=6$ cups of sugar. The recipe requires 4 times as much water as sugar, so Luka needs $4 \cdot 6=24$ cups of water.

OR

The recipe requires 4 times as much water as sugar and twice as much sugar as lemon juice. This means that Luka needs $4 \cdot 2=8$ times as much water as lemon juice. The amount of water he needs is $8 \cdot 3=24$ cups.
