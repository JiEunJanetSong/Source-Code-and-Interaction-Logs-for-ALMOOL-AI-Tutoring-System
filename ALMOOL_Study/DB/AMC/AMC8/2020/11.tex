After school, Maya and Naomi headed to the beach, 6 miles away. Maya decided to bike while Naomi took a bus. The graph below shows their journeys, indicating the time and distance traveled. What was the difference, in miles per hour, between Naomi's and Maya's average speeds?

Answer (E): Average speed equals the total distance traveled divided by the elapsed time. Maya covered the distance of 6 miles in 30 minutes, which is $\frac{1}{2}$ of an hour. Her average speed was $6 \div \frac{1}{2}=12$ miles per hour. Naomi covered the same distance in 10 minutes, which is $\frac{1}{6}$ of an hour. Her average speed was $6 \div \frac{1}{6}=36$ miles per hour. The difference between their average speeds was $36-12=24$ miles per hour.
