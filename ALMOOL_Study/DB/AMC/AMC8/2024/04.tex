When Yunji added all the integers from 1 to 9, she mistakenly left out a number. Her incorrect sum turned out to be a square number. What number did Yunji leave out?

Adding numbers 1 through 9 gives us 45. This was her expected sum, but what she got was a perfect square. Since she got that perfect square sum by forgetting a number, that sum is less than 45. The square number right under 45 is 36. So $45-36=9$. So the solution is $E[9]$.
