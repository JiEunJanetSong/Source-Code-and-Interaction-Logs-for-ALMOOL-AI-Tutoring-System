In January 1980 the Mauna Loa Observatory recorded carbon dioxide $(C O 2)$ levels of 338 ppm (parts per million). Over the years the average $C O 2$ reading has increased by about 1.515 ppm each year. What is the expected $C O 2$ level in ppm in January 2030? Round your answer to the nearest integer.

Solution 1
This is a time period of $2030-1980=50$ years, so we can expect the ppm to increase by $50 * 1.515=75.75 \approx 76 \mathrm{ppm}$. Since we started with 338 ppm , we have

$$
76+338=\text { (B) } 414 \text {. }

Solution 2
$2030-1980=50$ years. The ppm level in 2030 is

$$
338+50 * 1.515=338+75.75=413.75 \approx(\mathbf{B}) \mathbf{4 1 4} .
