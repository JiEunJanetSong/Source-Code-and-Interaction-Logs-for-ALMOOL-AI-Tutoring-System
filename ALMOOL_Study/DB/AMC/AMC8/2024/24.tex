Jean has made a piece of stained glass art in the shape of two mountains, as shown in the figure below. One mountain peak is 8 feet high while the other peak is 12 feet high. Each peak forms a $90^{\circ}$ angle, and the straight sides form a $45^{\circ}$ angle with the ground. The artwork has an area of 183 square feet. The sides of the mountain meet at an intersection point near the center of the artwork, $h$ feet above the ground. What is the value of $h$?

}\SetValue{Solution}{%

Extend the ``inner part" of the mountain so that the image is two right triangles that overlap in a third right triangle as shown.

\begin{center}		
    \includegraphics[scale=0.6]{AMC-8-pics/2024-24-s.png}
	\end{center}

	The side length of the largest right triangle is $12 \sqrt{2}$, which means its area is 144 . Similarly, the area of the second largest right triangle is 64 (the side length is $8 \sqrt{2}$ ), and the area of the overlap is $h^2$ (the side length is $h \sqrt{2}$ ). Because the right triangles have a side ratio of 1:1: $\sqrt{2}$. Thus,

	$$
	144+64-h^2=183
	$$
	
	which means that the answer is (B) 5 .

	Solution 2 (Using a Ruler)
	You can measure $h$ with a ruler (rulers are allowed on the AMC 8), and see that $h$ is closest to $(\mathbf{B}) 5$.
