Buzz Bunny is hopping up and down a set of stairs, one step at a time. In how many ways can Buzz Bunny start on the ground, make a sequence of $6$ hops, and end up back on the ground? (For example, one sequence of hops is up-up-down-down-up-down.)

Solution 1
Looking at the answer choices, you see that you can list them out. Doing this gets you:
UUDDUD
UDUDUD
UUUDDD
UDUUDD
UUDUDD
Counting all the paths listed above gets you (B) 5 .

Solution 2
Any combination can be written as some re-arrangement of UUUDDD. Clearly we must end going down, and start going up, so we need the number of ways to insert $2 U$ 's and $2 D$ 's into $U_{----} D$. There are $\binom{4}{2}=6$ ways, but we have to remove the case UDDUUD, giving us (B) 5 .
- We know there are no more cases since there will be at least one $U$ before we have a $D$ (from the first $U$ ), at least two $U$ 'S before two $D$ 's (since we removed the one case), and at least three $U$ 's before three $D$ 's, as we end with the third $D$.


Solution 3
These numbers are clearly the Catalan numbers. Since we have 6 steps, we need the third Catalan number, which is (B) 5 .
