Solution 1
Since she has half as many red marbles as green, we can call the number of red marbles $x$, and the number of green marbles $2 x$. Since she has half as many green marbles as blue, we can call the number of blue marbles $4 x$. Adding them up, we have: $7 x$ marbles. The number of marbles therefore must be a multiple of 7 , as $x$ represents an integer, so the only possible answer is (E) 28 .

Solution 2
Suppose Maria has $g$ green marbles and $t$ total marbles. She then has $\frac{g}{2}$ red marbles and $2 g$ blue marbles. Altogether, Maria has

$$
g+\frac{g}{2}+2 g=\frac{7 g}{2}=t
$$

marbles, so $g=\frac{2 t}{7}$, so $t$ must be a multiple of 7 . The only multiple of 7 in the answer choices is (E) 28 .
