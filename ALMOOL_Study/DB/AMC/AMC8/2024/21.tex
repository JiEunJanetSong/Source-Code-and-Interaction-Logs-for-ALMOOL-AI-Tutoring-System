A group of frogs (called an army) is living in a tree. A frog turns green when in the shade and turns yellow when in the sun. Initially, the ratio of green to yellow frogs was $3: 1$. Then 3 green frogs moved to the sunny side and 5 yellow frogs moved to the shady side. Now the ratio is $4: 1$. What is the difference between the number of green frogs and the number of yellow frogs now?

Solution 1
Let the initial number of green frogs be $g$ and the initial number of yellow frogs be $y$. Since the ratio of the number of green frogs to yellow frogs is initially $3: 1, g=3 y$. Now, 3 green frogs move to the sunny side and 5 yellow frogs move to the shade side, thus the new number of green frogs is $g+2$ and the new number of yellow frogs is $y-2$. We are given that $\frac{g+2}{y-2}=\frac{4}{1}$, so $g+2=4 y-8$, since $g=3 y$, we have $3 y+2=4 y-8$, so $y=10$ and $g=30$. Thus the answer is $(g+2)-(y-2)=32-8=\boxed{(E) 24}$. -anonchalantdreadhead

Solution 2
Since the original ratio is $3: 1$ and the new ratio is $4: 1$, the number of frogs must be a multiple of 12 , the only solutions left are $(B)$ and $(E)$.
Let's start with 12 frogs:
We must have 9 frogs in the shade and 3 frogs in the sun. After the change, there would be 11 frogs in the shade and 1 frog in the sun, which is not a $4: 1$ ratio.

Therefore the answer is: $(E) 24$.
