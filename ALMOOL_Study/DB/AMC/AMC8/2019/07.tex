Shauna는 각각 최대 100점의 가치가 있는 5개의 시험을 치릅니다. 처음 세 번의 시험 점수는 76점, 94점, 87점입니다. 5개의 시험에서 모두 평균 81점을 받으려면 나머지 2개의 시험 중 하나에서 받을 수 있는 가장 낮은 점수는 얼마인가?

}\SetValue{Solution}{%

To average 81 for all five tests, Shauna would have to earn a total of $5 \cdot 81=$ 405 points. So far, she has earned $76+94+87=257$ points, so she would need to earn $405-257=148$ points on the remaining two tests. The most she could score on one test is 100 points, so the lowest score she could earn on the other test is $148-100=48$ points.
