}\SetValue{Solution}{%

We are given two fair dice, each with the following faces:

$$
\{1,2,3,5,7,8\}
$$


We are to find the probability that the sum of the two dice is an even number.

Step 1: Understand even sums
A sum is even if:
- even + even = even
- odd + odd = even

A sum is odd if:
- even + odd = odd
- Step 2: Count even and odd numbers on a die

Given face values: $\{1,2,3,5,7,8\}$
- Even numbers: 2, $8 \rightarrow 2$ even numbers
- Odd numbers: 1, 3, 5, 7 - 4 odd numbers

So on each die:
- 2 even numbers
- 4 odd numbers

Step 3: Total number of outcomes
Since both dice have 6 faces:

$$
6 \times 6=36 \text { total outcomes }
$$

- Step 4: Count favorable outcomes (sum is even)

There are two favorable cases:
Case 1: Even + Even
- Die A is even: 2 choices
- Die B is even: 2 choices

$$
\rightarrow 2 \times 2=4 \text { outcomes }
$$


Case 2: Odd + Odd
- Die A is odd: 4 choices
- Die $B$ is odd: 4 choices

$$
\rightarrow 4 \times 4=16 \text { outcomes }
$$


So total favorable outcomes $=4+16=20$

Step 5: Compute probability

$$
\text { Probability }=\frac{\text { favorable outcomes }}{\text { total outcomes }}=\frac{20}{36}=\frac{5}{9}
$$

Answer (C)
}\SetValue{Solution MAA}{%

The table below shows that 20 of the 36 sums will be even.
\begin{tabular}{c|cccccc}
+ & 1 & 2 & 3 & 5 & 7 & 8 \\
\hline 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 6 & 8 & 9 \\
2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 7 & 9 & 10 \\
3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 8 & 10 & 11 \\
5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 10 & 12 & 13 \\
7 & 8 & 9 & 10 & 12 & 14 & 15 \\
8 & 9 & 10 & 11 & 13 & 15 & 16
\end{tabular}

Therefore the probability that the sum will be even is $\frac{20}{36}=\frac{5}{9}$.

OR

The sum is even provided both dice are even or both dice are odd. Because there is a $\frac{1}{3}$ probability of one die being even, there is a $\frac{1}{9}$ probability that both will be even. There is a $\frac{2}{3}$ probability that one will be odd and thus a $\frac{4}{9}$ probability that both will be odd. Thus the overall probability that the sum is even is $\frac{1}{9}+\frac{4}{9}=\frac{5}{9}$.
