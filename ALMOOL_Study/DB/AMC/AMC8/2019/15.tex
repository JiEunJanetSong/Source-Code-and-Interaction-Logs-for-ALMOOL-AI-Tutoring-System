On a beach, 50 people are wearing sunglasses and 35 people are wearing caps. Some people are wearing both sunglasses and caps. If one of the people wearing a cap is selected at random, the probability that this person is also wearing sunglasses is $\frac{2}{5}$. If instead, someone wearing sunglasses is selected at random, what is the probability that this person is also wearing a cap?

}\SetValue{Solution}{%

Because the probability that a cap-wearing person also wears sunglasses is $\frac{2}{5}$, it follows that the number of people wearing both caps and sunglasses is $\frac{2}{5} \cdot 35=14$. Thus the probability that a randomly chosen person with sunglasses is also wearing a cap is $\frac{14}{50}=\frac{7}{25}$.
