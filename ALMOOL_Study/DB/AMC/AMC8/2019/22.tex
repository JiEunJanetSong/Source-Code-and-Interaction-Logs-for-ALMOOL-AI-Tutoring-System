}\SetValue{Solution}{%

Suppose the original price of the shirt was 100 dollars and the price was increased by $x$ percent, producing a new price of $100+x$ dollars. Then decreasing the new price by $x$ percent is equivalent to multiplying $100+x$ by ( $100-x$ ) percent. The resulting price was 84 dollars. Thus

$$
\begin{aligned}
(100+x) \cdot \frac{100-x}{100} & =84 \\
100^2-x^2 & =8400 \\
x^2 & =1600 \\
x & =40
\end{aligned}
$$


Therefore the percent of increase and decrease was $40 \%$.
