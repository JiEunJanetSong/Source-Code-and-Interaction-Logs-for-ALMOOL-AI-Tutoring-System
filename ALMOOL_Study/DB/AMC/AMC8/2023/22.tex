\textbf{Solution 1}

In this solution, we will use trial and error to solve. 4000 can be expressed as $200 \times 20$. We divide 200 by 20 and get 10, divide 20 by 10 and get 2, and divide 10 by 2 to get $\square$
(D) 5. No one said that they have to be in ascending order!

\textbf{Solution 2}

Consider the first term is $a$ and the second term is $b$. Then, the following term will be $a b, a b^2$, $a^2 b^3$ and $a^3 b^5$. Notice that $4000=2^5 \times 5^3$, then we obtain $a=$ (D) 5 and $b=2$.
