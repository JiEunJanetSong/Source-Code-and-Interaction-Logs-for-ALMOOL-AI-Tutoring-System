Viswam walks half a mile to get to school each day. His route consists of 10 city blocks of equal length and he takes 1 minute to walk each block. Today, after walking 5 blocks, Viswam discovers he has to make a detour, walking 3 blocks of equal length instead of 1 block to reach the next corner. From the time he starts his detour, at what speed, in mph, must he walk, in order to get to school at his usual time?

비스왐은 매일 0.5마일을 걸어서 학교에 등교합니다. 그의 경로는 길이가 같은 10개의 도시 블록으로 구성되어 있으며 각 블록을 걷는 데 1분씩 걸립니다. 오늘은 5블록을 걷다가 다음 코너에 도달하기 위해 1블록이 아닌 같은 길이의 3블록을 우회하여 걸어야 한다는 사실을 알게 되었습니다. 우회를 시작한 시점부터 평소 시간에 맞춰 학교에 도착하려면 시속 몇 마일의 속도로 걸어야 할까요?

Note that Viswam walks at a constant speed of 60 blocks per hour as he takes 1 minute to walk each block. After walking 5 blocks, he has taken 5 minutes and has 5 minutes remaining to walk 7 blocks. Therefore, he must walk at a speed of $7 \cdot 60 \div 5=84$ blocks per hour to get to school on time, from the time he starts his detour. Since he normally walks $\frac{1}{2}$ mile, which is equal to 10 blocks, 1 mile is equal to 20 blocks. Therefore, he must walk at $84 \div 20=4.2 \mathrm{mph}$ from the time he starts his detour to get to school on time, so the answer is $\square$ (B) 4.2.
