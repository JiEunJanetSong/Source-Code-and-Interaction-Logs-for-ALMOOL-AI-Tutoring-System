Greta Grasshopper sits on a long line of lily pads in a pond. From any lily pad, Greta can jump 5 pads to the right or 3 pads to the left. What is the fewest number of jumps Greta must make to reach the lily pad located 2023 pads to the right of her starting point?

We have 2 directions going 5 right or 3 left. We can assign a variable to each of these directions. We can call going right 1 direction X and we can call going 1 left Y . We can build an equation of $5 \mathrm{X}-3 \mathrm{Y}=2023$, where we have to limit the number of moves we do. We can do this by making more of our moves the 5 move turn than the 3 move turn. The first obvious step is to go some amount of moves in the right direction then subtract off in the left direction to land on 2023. The least amount of 3's added to 2023 to make a multiple of 5 is 4 as $2023+4(3)=2035$. So now, we have solved the problem as we just go $\frac{2035}{5}=407$ hops right, and just do 4 more hops left. Yielding $407+4=$ (D) 411 as our answer.
