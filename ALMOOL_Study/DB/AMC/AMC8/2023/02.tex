Analysis

\textbf{The square is folded twice:}

1. First in half (say, horizontally),

2. Then in half again (say, vertically),

$\Rightarrow$ This results in one top-left quarter square visible when fully folded.

\textbf{A single diagonal cut is made through the folded corner.}

\textbf{When unfolded:}

- The diagonal cut is reflected across both folds.

- So, it produces four symmetrical diagonal slits radiating from the centers of each quadrant.

Unfolded Result

This pattern corresponds to four triangles pointing toward the center, forming a symmetric X-like shape.
