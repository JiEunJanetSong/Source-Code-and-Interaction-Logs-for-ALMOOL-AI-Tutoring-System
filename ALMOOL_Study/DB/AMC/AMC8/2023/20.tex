Two integers are inserted into the list $3$, $3$, $8$, $11$, $28$ to double its range. The mode and median remain unchanged. What is the maximum possible sum of the two additional numbers?

}\SetValue{Solution}{%

To double the range, we must find the current range, which is $28-3=25$, to then double to: $2(25)=50$. Since we do not want to change the median, we need to get a value less than 8 (as 8 would change the mode) for the smaller, making 53 fixed for the larger.
Anything less than 3 is not beneficial to the optimization because you want to get the largest range without changing the mode. So, taking our optimal values of 7 and 53 , we have an answer of $7+53=(\mathbf{D}) 60$.
