Step 1: Bella's current age

Five years ago, Bella was $6 \rightarrow$ Now she's:

$$
6+5=11
$$


Step 2: Kitten's age

The kitten was a newborn (0 years old) five years ago $\rightarrow$ Now it's:

$$
0+5=5
$$


Step 3: Total age today is 30

Let Anna's age be $x$. Then:

$$
x+11+5=30 \Rightarrow x=14
$$


Step 4: Difference between Anna and Bella

$$
14-11=3
$$

Therefore, Anna is $14-11=$ (C) 3 years older than Bella.
