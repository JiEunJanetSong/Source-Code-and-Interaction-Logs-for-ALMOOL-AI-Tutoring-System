A $\triangle$ or $\bigcirc$ is placed in each of the nine squares in a 3-by-3 grid. Shown below is a sample configuration with three $\triangle s$ in a line.

Mathematical Solution

We want to count the number of configurations on a $3 \times 3$ grid in which:

- There are 3 triangles ( $\Delta$ ) in a line,

- And 3 circles (O) in a line.

Note: A ``line" refers to a row, column, or diagonal. But diagonals cannot be simultaneously used for both $\Delta$ and $O$ without overlapping or violating the line rule. Hence, only vertical or horizontal line arrangements are valid.

Step 1: Consider vertical lines only (we'll double later)

There are 3 vertical columns. We perform case analysis:

Case 1: Two lines of one shape, one of the other

Let's say 2 columns have $\Delta$ and 1 column has $\bigcirc$ (or vice versa).

- Choose the column with the lone different shape: $\binom{3}{1}=3$ ways.

- Choose which symbol is in the minority (the one appearing once): 2 choices ( $\triangle$ once or $\bigcirc$ once).

Total:

$$
3 \times 2=6
$$


Case 2: One line of $\Delta$, one line of $O$, and one mixed

- Choose which column has $\Delta$, which has $\bigcirc$, and which is mixed: $3!=6$ ways.

- The mixed column must contain both $\Delta$ and $O$. There are $2^3=8$ total ways to fill 3 cells with $\Delta$ or O, but we must exclude:

- All $\triangle$ : 1 way

- All O: 1 way

So, valid mixed patterns: $8-2=6$

Total:

$$
6 \times 6=36
$$


Final step: Account for horizontal cases

Since rows are symmetric to columns, multiply by 2 :

$$
2 \times(6+36)=2 \times 42=84
$$

(D) 84.
