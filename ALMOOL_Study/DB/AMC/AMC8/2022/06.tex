}\SetValue{Solution}{%

We are told:

- Three numbers are equally spaced.

- Middle number $=15$

- Largest number $=4 \times$ smallest number

Step 1: Let smallest number $=x$

Then the three numbers are:

$$
x, \quad 15, \quad 4 x
$$


Since they are equally spaced, the difference between consecutive numbers must be the same:

$$
15-x=4 x-15
$$


Step 2: Solve the equation

$$
\begin{aligned}
& 15-x=4 x-15 \\
& 30=5 x \Rightarrow x=6
\end{aligned}
$$

Answer: (C) 6
