Solution 1
The sum of all five numbers is 85 . Since 85 is 1 more than a multiple of 4 , the number being subtracted must be 1 more than a multiple of 4 . Thus, the answer is (C) 17 . $\sim$ Gavin_Deng

Solution 2
The sum of the residues of these numbers modulo 4 is $-1+0+1+2+3=5 \equiv 1(\bmod 4)$. Hence, the number being subtracted must be congruent to 1 modulo 4 . The only such answer is (C) 17 . ~cxsmi

Solution 3
We try out every number using brute force and get (C) 17 .
