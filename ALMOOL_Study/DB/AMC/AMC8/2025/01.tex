Solution 1
Each of the unshaded triangles has base length 2 and height 1 , so they all have area $\frac{2 \cdot 1}{2}=1$. Each of the unshaded unit squares has area 1 . The area of the shaded region is equal to the area of the entire grid minus the area of the unshaded region, or $4^2-4 \cdot 1-4 \cdot 1=8$. The star is then $\frac{8}{16}=\frac{1}{2}=\frac{50}{100}$, or $(\mathrm{B}) 50$ percent of the entire grid.

Solution 2
There are 16 total squares in the diagram and each square has 2 triangles whose areas are half the area of a unit square. Thus, the total number of triangles in the diagram is $4^2 \cdot 2=32$ triangles. There are 16 shaded triangles in the diagram, so the area of the star is $\frac{16}{32}=\frac{1}{2}=\frac{50}{100}$, or (B) 50 percent. 

Solution 3
Quite simply, we can rearrange the triangles to make a two-column section which is (B) 50 percent of the entire grid. ~shreyan.chethan

Solution 4
Note that we can move one triangle from each of the four cells in the middle to each of the four corners. This will leave every cell in the grid with one triangle each, and each triangle has an area of half the area of each cell. Thus, our answer must equal to $\frac{1}{2}$, and so our answer is
(B) 50 .
