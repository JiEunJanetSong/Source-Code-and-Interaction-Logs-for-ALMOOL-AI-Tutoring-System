Solution 1
The Condition (II) perfect square must end in "00" because ...99 + $1=\ldots 00$ Condition (I). Four-digit perfect squares ending in " 00 " are $40,50,60,70,80,90$.

Condition (II) also says the number is in the form $n^2-1$. By the Difference of Squares, $n^2-1=(n+1)(n-1)$. Hence:
- $40^2-1=(39)(41)$
- $50^2-1=(49)(51)$
- $60^2-1=(59)(61)$
- $70^2-1=(69)(71)$
- $80^2-1=(79)(81)$
- $90^2-1=(89)(91)$

On this list, the only number that is the product of 2 prime numbers is $60^2-1=(59)(61)$, so the answer is (B) 1 .
