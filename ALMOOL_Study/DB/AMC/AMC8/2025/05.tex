Betty drives a truck to deliver packages in a neighborhood whose street map is shown below. Betty starts at the factory (labled $F$ ) and drives to location $A$, then $B$, then $C$, before returning to $F$. What is the shortest distance, in blocks, she can drive to complete the route?

Solution 1

Each shortest possible path from $A$ to $B$ follows the edges of the rectangle. The following path outlines a path of $\square$ (C) 24 units:

	Solution 2

	We can find the shortest distance using a line diagonally from one point to the other, creating a sort of slope, then find the sum of rise and run of the slope, which happens to be the shortest distance, repeat this process until you get back to Point $F$, and you should get $2+1+3+7+4+2+1+4$, which is equal to $($ C) $24 . \sim$ Imhappy 62789
