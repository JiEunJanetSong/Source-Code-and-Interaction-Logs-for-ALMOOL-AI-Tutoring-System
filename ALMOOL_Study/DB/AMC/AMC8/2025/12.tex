Solution 1
The largest circle that can fit inside the figure has its center in the middle of the figure and will be tangent to the figure in 8 points. By the Pythagorean Theorem, the distance from the center to one of these 8 points is $\sqrt{2^2+1^2}=\sqrt{5}$, so the area of this circle is

$$
\pi \sqrt{5}^2=\mathbf{( C )} 5 \pi
$$


Solution 2 (very unrecommended)
Draw the circle in the grid and analyze the radius. It's radius is a little more than 2 but a lot less than 2.5 , so the area is a little more than $4 \pi$. So, the area of the circle is $(\mathbf{C}) 5 \pi$ with a radius of approximately 2.23 .
