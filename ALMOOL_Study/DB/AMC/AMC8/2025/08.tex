Solution 1
Each of the 6 faces of the cube have equal area, so the area of each face is equal to $\frac{18}{6}=3$, making the side length $\sqrt{3}$. From this, we can see that the volume of the cube is

$$
\sqrt{3}^3=\text { (A) } 3 \sqrt{3}
$$


Solution 2
Let the side length of the cube shown be equal to $s$ centimeters. The surface area of this cube is equal to the area of the net of the cube, which is equal to 18 square centimeters. The surface area of this cube is also $6 s^2$ square centimeters, so we have

$$
6 s^2=18 \Longrightarrow s^2=\frac{18}{6}=3 \Longrightarrow s=\sqrt{3} .
$$


However, we aren't done. We have found that the side length of the cube is $\sqrt{3} \mathrm{~cm}$, but the question asks for the volume of the cube, which is equal to $s^3=\sqrt{3}^3=$ (A) $3 \sqrt{3}$ cubic centimeters.
