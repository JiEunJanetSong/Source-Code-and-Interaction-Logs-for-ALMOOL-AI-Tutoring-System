Solution 1
Let's take the numbers 2 through 14 (evens). The remainders will be $2,4,6,1,3,5$, and 0 . This sequence keeps repeating itself over and over. We can take floor $(50 / 14)=3$, so after the number 42, every remainder has been achieved 3 times. However, since 44, 46, 48, and 50 are left, the remainders of those will be $2,4,6$, and 1 respectively. The only histogram in which those 4 numbers are set at 4 is histogram (A).

Solution 2
Writing down all the remainders gives us

$$
2,4,6,1,3,5,0,2,4,6,1,3,5,0,2,4,6,1,3,5,0,2,4,6,1 .
$$


In this list, there are 3 numbers with remainder 0,4 numbers with remainder 1,4 numbers with remainder 2,3 numbers with remainder 3,4 numbers with remainder 4,3 numbers with remainder 5 , and 4 numbers with remainder 6 . Manually computation of every single term can be avoided by recognizing the pattern alternates from $0,2,4,6$ to $1,3,5$ and there are 25 terms. The only histogram that matches this is $\square$ (A)

Solution 3
First, we find all of the multiples of 7 that are even, and are therefore, in this list. Knowing that 7 is odd, and that odd+odd=even, we can find all of the even multiples of 7 by simply finding all of the multiples of 14 that fit on this list. Doing this, we end up with

$$
14,28,42 .
$$


Now, we can clearly see that there are only 3 numbers in this list with 0 as a remainder. This disproves 2 of our 5 answers immediately. Since our remaining answers are identical until we reach 3 as a remainder, we can skip right to there. Now, we need to find all even numbers that leave a remainder of 3 when divided by 7 . To do this, we add 3 to all ODD multiples of 7 because odd+odd=even. This gives us

$$
10,24,38 .
$$


Note that we don't add 3 to 49 because that exceeds 50 . This shows us that there are only 3 numbers on this list that have a remainder of 3 when divided by 7 , disproving histograms B and $C$, which say that there are 4 of these numbers. This reveals the answer to be $\square$ (A)
