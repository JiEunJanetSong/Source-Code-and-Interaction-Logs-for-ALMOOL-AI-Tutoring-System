The circle shown below on the left has a radius of 1 unit. The region between the circle and the inscribed square is shaded. In the circle shown on the right, one quarter of the region between the circle and the inscribed square is shaded. The shaded regions in the two circles have the same area. What is the radius $R$, in units, of the circle on the right?

Solution
The area of the shaded region in the circle on the left is the area of the circle minus the area of the square, or $(\pi-2)$. The shaded area in the circle on the right is $\frac{1}{4}$ of the area of the circle minus the area of the square, or $\frac{\pi R^2-2 R^2}{4}$, which can be factored as $\frac{R^2(\pi-2)}{4}$. Since the shaded areas are equal to each other, we have $\pi-2=\frac{R^2(\pi-2)}{4}$, which simplifies to $R^2=4$. Taking the square root, we have $R=$ (B) 2

Solution 2
We start with the first area. Since the square is inscribed, its diagonal is $2 \Longrightarrow$ its side length is $\sqrt{2} \Longrightarrow$ its area is 2 , therefore the first area is $\pi-2$. The second area is $\frac{R^2 \pi-2 R^2}{4}$, found in a similar manner. Writing and solving the equation, we have

$$
\pi-2=\frac{R^2 \pi-2 R^2}{4} \Longrightarrow 4(\pi-2)=R^2(\pi-2) \Longrightarrow R=2 .
$$


The answer is (B) 2 
Solution 3 (Using similarity)
Since the two figures are similar, and the 4 regions in the first circle are equal in area to one of the four regions in the second circle, the second figure's area is 4 times the first figure's area. Therefore, the side lengths are multiplied by a factor of $\sqrt{4}=2$, so the answer is $1 \cdot 2=(\mathrm{B}) 2$.
