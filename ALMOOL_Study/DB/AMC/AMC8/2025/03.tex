Solution 1
We start with Annika and 3 of her friends playing, meaning that there are 4 players. This must mean that there is a total of $4 \cdot 15=60$ cards. If 2 more players joined, there would be 6 players, and since the cards need to be split evenly, this would mean that each player gets $\frac{60}{6}=(\mathrm{C}) 10$ Buffalo Shuffle-O cards each meaning that the final answer is 10 .
