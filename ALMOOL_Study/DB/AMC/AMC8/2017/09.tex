Answer (D): The total number of Marcy's marbles must be divisible by both 3 and 4 thus it must be a multiple of 12. If she has just 12 marbles, then 4 are blue and 3 are red, leaving just 5 other marbles, so she could not have 6 green marbles. If she has 24 marbles, then 8 are blue and 6 are red, leaving 10 other marbles, so she could have 6 green marbles and 4 yellow marbles. The smallest number of yellow marbles that Marcy would have is 4.
