Starting with some gold coins and some empty treasure chests, I tried to put 9 gold coins in each treasure chest, but that left 2 treasure chests empty. So instead I put 6 gold coins in each treasure chest, but then I had 3 gold coins left over. How many gold coins did I have?

Answer (C): After putting 9 coins in all but two of the chests, I could take 3 coins out of each chest to leave 6 coins in those chests. Doing this would allow me to fill the remaining 2 chests with 6 coins each, and have another 3 coins left over. So I must have removed 15 coins ( 3 from each of 5 chests). Thus I initially had put 9 coins into each of 5 chests, making for a total of 45 coins (and 7 chests).

OR

Let $c$ be the number of chests. Then $9(c-2)=6 c+3$. Solving yields $c=7$, so the number of coins is $6 \cdot 7+3=9(7-2)=45$.
