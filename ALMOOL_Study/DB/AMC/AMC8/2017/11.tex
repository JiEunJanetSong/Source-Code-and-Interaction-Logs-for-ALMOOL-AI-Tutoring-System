Answer (C): If the total number of tiles in the two diagonals is 37, there are 19 tiles in each diagonal (with one tile appearing in both diagonals). The number of tiles on a diagonal is equal to the number of tiles on a side. Therefore, the square floor is covered by $19 \times 19=361$ square tiles.
