The clock in Sri's car, which is not accurate, gains time at a constant rate. One day as he begins shopping he notes that his car clock and his watch (which is accurate) both say 12:00 noon. When he is done shopping, his watch says $12: 30$ and his car clock says $12: 35$. Later that day, Sri loses his watch. He looks at his car clock and it says 7:00. What is the actual time?

}\SetValue{Solution}{%

Answer (B): The ratio of time as measured by Sri's car clock to actual time is $\frac{35}{30}=\frac{7}{6}$. Therefore when the clock shows that 7 hours have passed since noon, only 6 hours have actually passed, so the actual time is 6:00.

OR

Gaining 5 minutes every half hour is equivalent to gaining 1 hour every 6 hours. Hence when the car clock reads 7:00 the actual time is $6: 00$.
