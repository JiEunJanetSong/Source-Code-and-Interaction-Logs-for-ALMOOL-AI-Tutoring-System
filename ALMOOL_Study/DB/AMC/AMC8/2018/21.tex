Answer (E): Let $n$ be a positive three-digit integer that satisfies the conditions stated in the problem. Note that because $n$ has a remainder of 2 when divided by $6, n+4$ is divisible by 6. Similarly, $n+4$ is divisible by 9 and 11. Hence $n+4$ is divisible by the least common multiple of 6, 9, and 11, which is 198. Thus $n+4=198 k$ where $k=1,2,3,4$, or 5. So $n=194,392$, 590,788, or 986, and there are therefore five positive three-digit integers satisfying the given conditions.
