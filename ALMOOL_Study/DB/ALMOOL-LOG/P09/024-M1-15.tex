    Of course! Here's the problem and its explanation in English:

    Problem: In the linear function $f, f(0)=8$ and $f(1)=12$. Which equation defines $f$ ?

    You are given four options:

    - A: $f(x)=12 x+8$

    - B: $f(x)=4 x$

    - C: $f(x)=4 x+12$

    - D: $f(x)=4 x+8$
    
    Solution:

    The function $f(x)$ is linear and can be expressed as $f(x)=a x+b$, where $a$ and $b$ are constants.
    1. Since $f(0)=8$, substituting 0 for $x$, we have
    
    $$
    f(0)=a(0)+b=8 \Longrightarrow b=8
    $$
    
    2. Now, the equation becomes $f(x)=a x+8$. Using the condition $f(1)=12$, substitute 1 for $x$ :
    
    $$
    f(1)=a(1)+8=12 \Longrightarrow a+8=12
    $$
    
    3. Solving for $a$, subtract 8 from both sides:
    
    $$
    a=4
    $$
    
    4. Substitute $a=4$ back into the equation $f(x)=a x+8$ :
    
    $$
    f(x)=4 x+8
    $$
    
    
    Therefore, the correct equation that defines $f$ is Option D: $f(x)=4 x+8$.
