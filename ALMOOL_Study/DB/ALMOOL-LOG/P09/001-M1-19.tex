    왜 B가 아니야?  
\end{GPTQ}

\begin{GPTA}
Choice B, which is 86, might seem an option if there's confusion in the calculation process. Let's go over the solution step by step to clarify why this is not the correct answer:

    1. Area of Circle A:

    - The radius of circle A is given as $3 n$.

    - The formula for the area of a circle is $A=\pi r^2$.

    - Hence, the area of circle A is:
    
    $$
    A_A=\pi(3 n)^2=9 \pi n^2
    $$
    
    2. Area of Circle B:

    - The radius of circle $B$ is given as $129 n$.

    - Therefore, the area of circle B is:
    
    $$
    A_B=\pi(129 n)^2=16,641 \pi n^2
    $$
    
    3. Comparing the Areas:

    - To find out how many times the area of circle B is compared to the area of circle A, divide t he area of circle B by the area of circle A:
    
    $$
    \frac{A_B}{A_A}=\frac{16,641 \pi n^2}{9 \pi n^2}=\frac{16,641}{9}=1,849
    $$
    
    
    The reason choice $\mathbf{B}(86)$ is incorrect is that there might be a mistake in calculation or a misunderstandin g of the comparison being made. Choices should come from correctly dividing the areas calculated above, leading to the answer being 1,8449 times, which corresponds to choice D.
