    how do you find the diameter of the cone 
\end{GPTQ}

\begin{GPTA}
    To find the diameter of the cone, you need to use the information given about the frustum:

    1. Given Information:

    - The diameter of the bottom circle of the frustum is three times the diameter of the top circle

    - Let's denote the diameter of the top circle as $d$. 

    Therefore, the diameter of the bottom circle is $3 d$.

    2. Understanding the Cone Structure:

    - The original cone (before it was truncated to create the frustum) has the same base diameter as the bottom circle of the frustum, which is $3 d$.
    
    Thus, once you have determined the diameter of the top circle $d$ through the context of the problem or a dditional given values, the diameter of the entire cone at its base is $3 d$.

    If you have more details or specific values, please share them, and I can help further!
