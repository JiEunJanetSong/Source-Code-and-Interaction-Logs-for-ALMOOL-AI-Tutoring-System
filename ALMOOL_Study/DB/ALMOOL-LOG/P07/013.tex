    what is four significant figures?  
\end{GPTQ}

\begin{GPTA}
    Four significant figures in a number refer to the first four digits that are significant in representing the pr ecision of that number. These are the most meaningful digits and include all non-zero digits, any zeros b etween them, and any trailing zeros in the decimal portion.

    Let's break this down with some examples:

    1. 12345: The first four significant figures are $1,2,3$, and 4, making it 1234.

    2. 0.004567 : The first four significant figures will be $4,5,6$, and 7, written as 0.004567.

    3. 678000: The first four significant figures are $6,7,8$, and 0, resulting in 6780.

    4. 0.00098: The significant figures start from the first non-zero digit, so the first two significant figur es are 9 and 8, which are 0.00098 up to four significant figures as trailing zeros after a decimal co unt.
    
    Understanding significant figures is important when dealing with scientific measurements, as they conve $y$ the precision of a given number.
