    Should I find both volume of cube and sphere?
\end{GPTQ}

Yes, to determine the volume of the space inside the cube that is not occupied by the sphere, you need to find both the volume of the cube and the volume of the sphere. Here's how you can do that:

    1. Volume of the Cube: Use the formula $V_{\text {cube }}=s^3$, where $s$ is the edge length of the cube. For a cu be with edge length 68 inches:
    
    $$
    V_{\text {cube }}=68^3=314,432 \text { cubic inches }
    $$
    
    2. Volume of the Sphere: Use the formula $V_{\text {sphere }}=\frac{4}{3} \pi r^3$, where $r$ is the radius of the sphere. For a sphere with radius 34 inches:
    
    $$
    V_{\text {sphere }}=\frac{4}{3} \pi(34)^3 \approx 164,636 \text { cubic inches }
    $$
    
    3. Volume of the Empty Space: Subtract the volume of the sphere from the volume of the cube to fi nd the volume of the space not taken up by the sphere:
    
    $$
    V_{\text {space }}=V_{\text {cube }}-V_{\text {spbere }}=314,432-164,636=149,796 \text { cubic inches }
    $$
    
    
    This calculation will give you the volume of the space inside the cube that is not occupied by the sphere.
