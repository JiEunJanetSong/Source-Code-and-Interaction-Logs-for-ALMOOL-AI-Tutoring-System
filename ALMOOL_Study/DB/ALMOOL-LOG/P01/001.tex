    How can I know they are similar?   
\end{GPTQ}

\begin{GPTA}
 In this problem, it's explicitly stated that triangles $L M N$ and $P Q R$ are similar. In geometry, two triangle $s$ are considered similar if their corresponding angles are equal, and their corresponding sides are proport ional.

    Since the problem tells us that the triangles are similar, we have the following:

    1. The corresponding angles of the triangles are congruent (equal in measure).

    2. The lengths of their corresponding sides have the same ratio.
    
    In this particular problem, you don't need to establish the similarity-they've already told you that the tri angles are similar. Given this information, any corresponding angles in both triangles, such as angle $M$ i n triangle $L M N$ and angle $Q$ in triangle $P Q R$, will have the same measure. In this case, angle $Q$ must measure $53^{\circ}$, just like angle $M$.
