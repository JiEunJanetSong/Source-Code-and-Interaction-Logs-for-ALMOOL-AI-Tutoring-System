    Is this question just finding area of square?   
\end{GPTQ}

\begin{GPTA}
 This question is actually about finding the area of a rectangle, not a square. In the problem, the dimensio ns given are a length of 34 centimeters and a width of 29 centimeters, which are different.

    A square is a special type of rectangle where all four sides have the same length. In this case, since the le ngth and width are different, it forms a rectangle, not a square. The area of a rectangle is calculated using the formula:
    
    $$
    A=\ell \cdot w
    $$
    
    where $\ell$ is the length and $w$ is the width. Substituting the given dimensions:
    
    $$
    A=34 \times 29=986 \text { square centimeters }
    $$
    
    
    So, the area of the rectangle is 986 square centimeters.
