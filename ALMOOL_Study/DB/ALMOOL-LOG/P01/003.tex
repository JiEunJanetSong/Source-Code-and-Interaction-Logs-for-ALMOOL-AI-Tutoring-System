    For right triangles, you should use the Pythagorean theorem. This theorem states that if a right triangle h as a hypotenuse with length $c$ and legs with lengths $a$ and $b$, the relationship between these sides is given by:

    $$
    c^2=a^2+b^2
    $$
    
    
    This allows you to solve for the length of the hypotenuse $c$ when you know the lengths of the other two s ides, $a$ and $b$. In this problem, the values are $a=4$ and $b=5$.
    To find $c$, you will calculate:
    
    $$
    c=\sqrt{a^2+b^2}=\sqrt{4^2+5^2}
    $$
