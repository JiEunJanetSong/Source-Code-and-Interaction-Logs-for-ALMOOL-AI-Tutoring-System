    Can you tell me the major mistakes for this question?   
\end{GPTQ}

\begin{GPTA}
 Certainly! Let's identify the major mistakes that could potentially occur when solving this problem:

1. Misunderstanding Similar Triangles:

- A common mistake is forgetting that similar triangles have congruent corresponding angles. This means that if $\angle Z$ corresponds to $\angle T$, they must have the same measure.

2. Confusion with Correspondences:

- It's important to correctly identify the correspondences between angles. Mistaking which an gles correspond to each other could lead to incorrect conclusions.

3. Incorrect Calculation of Angles:

- A misunderstanding that the problem involves some arithmetic manipulation of angles, such as taking half or double, instead of recognizing them as being congruent.

4. Ignoring Given Information:

- The problem states that $\angle Z=20^{\circ}$, which directly tells you the measure of $\angle T$. Ignoring thi s information can lead to overcomplicating the solution.
   
To correctly solve the problem, focus on the property of similar triangles that states corresponding angle s are congruent, thus $\angle Z=\angle T=20^{\circ}$.
