 Certainly! Let's break it down step-by-step.

    Given the right triangle $\triangle R S T$, we know the side lengths:    

    - $R S=20$

- $S T=48$

- $T R=52$

We want to find $\tan W$, where $W$ corresponds to $T$ because the triangles are similar and the angles $T$ an $\mathrm{d} W$ are congruent.

1. Identifying Sides:

- In $\triangle R S T$, angle $T$ is acute.

- The hypotenuse is $T R=52$.

- The side opposite angle $T$ is $R S=20$.

- The side adjacent to angle $T$ is $S T=48$.

2. Calculating $\tan T$ :

The formula for the tangent of an angle in a right triangle is:

$$
\tan (\text { angle })=\frac{\text { opposite side }}{\text { adjacent side }}
$$


For angle $T$ :

$$
\tan T=\frac{R S}{S T}=\frac{20}{48}
$$


Simplifying this fraction:

$$
\tan T=\frac{5}{12}
$$

1. Conclusion:

Since $\triangle R S T \sim \triangle U V W$ and $T$ corresponds to $W$, they have the same tangent value:

$$
\tan W=\tan T=\frac{5}{12}
$$


Thus, the value of $\tan W$ is $\frac{5}{12}$.
