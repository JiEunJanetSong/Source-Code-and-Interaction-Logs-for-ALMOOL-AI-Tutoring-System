\end{GPTQ}

\begin{GPTA}
The ``L-like" shape in mathematical notation next to three alphabets, such as $\angle A B C$, is a symbol represe nting an angle. Here's a brief explanation:

- The notation $\angle A B C$ specifically refers to the angle at point $B$, which is the vertex of the angle.

- Points $A, B$, and $C$ are typically labeled so that $B$ is the vertex, and $A$ and $C$ are points on the line segments that form the angle.

So, when you see this symbol, it indicates that we're talking about the measure of an angle formed by lines or segments meeting at a point. This notation is commonly used in geometry to describe and work wit h angles.
