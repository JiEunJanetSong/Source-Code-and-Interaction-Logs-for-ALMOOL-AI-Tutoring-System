\begin{GPTQ}
    how do I know that lines have same length? 
\end{GPTQ}

\begin{GPTA}
In the given problem, it is explicitly stated that $|\overline{R S}|=|\overline{S T}|$. This information is provided as part of the assumptions for solving the problem, indicating that segments $\overline{R S}$ and $\overline{S T}$ are of equal length.

Additionally, the diagram may have markings (often shown as small tick marks) that visually indicate th e segments are equal. This type of visual cue, along with the problem statement, confirms that the length s of the lines $\overline{R S}$ and $\overline{S T}$ are the same. Always make sure to note such given information as it is crucial for solving geometric problems.
