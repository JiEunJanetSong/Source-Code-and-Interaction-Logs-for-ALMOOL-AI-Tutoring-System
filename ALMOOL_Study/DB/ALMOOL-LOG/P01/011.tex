\begin{GPTQ}
    Is it length of All combined side length?   
\end{GPTQ}

\begin{GPTA}
    Yes, exactly! The perimeter is the total length you get when you add up all the side lengths of a polygon. In simpler terms, it's like taking a walk around the entire edge of a shape and measuring the distance you covered. For any shape, just add the lengths of all its sides to find the perimeter. For instance, if a polygo n has sides of lengths $a, b, c$, and $d$, the perimeter would be:

    $$
    P=a+b+c+d
    $$
