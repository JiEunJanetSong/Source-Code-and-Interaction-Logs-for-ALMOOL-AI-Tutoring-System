\end{GPTQ}

\begin{GPTA}
 To solve this problem, let's understand what's given and what we're asked to interpret:

    1. The function $f(w)=6 w^2$ represents the area of a rectangle with width $w$ and length $6 w$.

    2. We're given $f(14)=1176$.
    
    The task is to interpret this statement correctly. Here's a simple step-by-step approach:

    1. Identify the function and variables:

    - $w$ is the width of the rectangle.

    - $f(w)$ calculates the area of the rectangle.

    2. Apply $w=14$ to the function:
    
    $$
    f(14)=6 \times 14^2
    $$
    
    3. Calculate the above expression:
    
    $$
    \begin{gathered}
    14^2=196 \\
    6 \times 196=1176
    \end{gathered}
    $$
    
    4. Interpret the meaning of $f(14)=1176$ :

    - The statement $f(14)=1176$ confirms that if the width $w$ is 14 feet, the function calculates t he area to be 1176 square feet. Thus, the correct interpretation is that if the width of the recta ngle is 14 feet, the area of the rectangle is 1176 square feet.
    
    Therefore, choice A is indeed correct, as it correctly matches this interpretation.
