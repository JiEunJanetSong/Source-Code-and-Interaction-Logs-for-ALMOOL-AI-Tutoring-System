\begin{GPTQ}
    the total angles of ABE triangle is 180 right?
\end{GPTQ}

\begin{GPTA}
Yes, you're correct! In any triangle, the sum of the interior angles is always $180^{\circ}$. This is a fundamental property of triangles.

    For the triangle $\triangle A B E$, you would have:
    
    $$
    \angle A+\angle B+\angle A E B=180^{\circ}
    $$
    
    
    In this geometry problem, $\angle A E B$ is one of the angles of triangle $\triangle A B E$, and when combined with the other two angles $\angle A$ and $\angle B$, they sum to $180^{\circ}$.
