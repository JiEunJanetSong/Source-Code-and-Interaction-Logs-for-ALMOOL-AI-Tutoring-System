\begin{GPTA}
    A right triangle, also known as a right-angled triangle, is a type of triangle that has one angle exactly equal to $90^{\circ}$. This right angle gives the triangle its name. Here are some key characteristics of a right triangle:

1. Right Angle: The triangle includes one angle that measures $90^{\circ}$.

2. Sides:

- The side opposite the right angle is known as the hypotenuse. It is the longest side of the triangle.

- The other two sides are known as the legs or catheti of the triangle.

3. Pythagorean Theorem: In a right triangle, the relationship between the lengths of the sides is given by the Pythagorean Theorem:

$$
a^2+b^2=c^2
$$

where $c$ is the length of the hypotenuse, and $a$ and $b$ are the lengths of the other two sides.

4. Trigonometry: Right triangles are fundamental to trigonometry. Various trigonometric ratios (sine, cosine, and tangent) are defined in terms of the sides of right triangles.

Right triangles are widely used in geometry, trigonometry, and various applications in science and engineering. If you have any further questions or need examples, feel free to ask!
