\end{GPTQ}

Let's break it down into manageable steps for the division and square root calculations.

Division Step:

In the process, we need to calculate $r^2=\frac{39,600 \times 3 \times 7}{22 \times 18}$. Let's compute this step by step:

1. Multiply the Numerator:

$$
39,600 \times 3 \times 7=831,600
$$

2. Multiply the Denominator:

$$
22 \times 18=396
$$

3. Perform the Division:

Now, divide the result from the numerator by the denominator:

$$
r^2=\frac{831,600}{396}
$$


Calculate this division:

$$
r^2=2100
$$


Square Root Calculation:

Once you have $r^2=2100$, you need to find the square root of 2100 to find $r$.

- The square root is a value that, when multiplied by itself, gives the original number. In symbols, if $ r=\sqrt{2100}$, then $r \times r=2100$.  
  
Calculate the square root of 2100 :

    1. Calculate the Square Root:
    
    $$
    r=\sqrt{2100} \approx 45.83
    $$
    
    
    This gives you the radius of the cone, approximately 45.83 cm.

    By following these steps, you can calculate each part systematically and understand the operations involved.
