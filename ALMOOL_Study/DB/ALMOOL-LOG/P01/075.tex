    Certainly! Let's go through the steps to solve the problem of finding the size of an interior angle of a reg ular nonagon.

Problem:

Find the size of an interior angle of a regular nonagon.
Steps to Solve:

1. Identify the Properties:

- A regular nonagon is a polygon with 9 equal sides and 9 equal interior angles.

2. Use the Interior Angle Formula:

The formula to calculate the size of an interior angle of a regular polygon is:

$$
\text { Interior Angle }=\frac{(n-2) \times 180}{n}
$$


Where $n$ is the number of sides of the polygon.

3. Substitute the Given Value:

Since a nonagon has 9 sides, substitute $n=9$ into the formula:

$$
\text { Interior Angle }=\frac{(9-2) \times 180}{9}=\frac{7 \times 180}{9}
$$

4. Perform the Calculations:

Compute the expression step-by-step:

$$
7 \times 180=1260 \frac{1260}{9}=140
$$

5. Conclude the Solution:

Each interior angle of a regular nonagon is $140^{\circ}$.
These are the steps to determine the size of an interior angle in a regular nonagon. Let me know if you $n$ eed any further clarification!
