    what are those sticks next to alphabet?  
\end{GPTQ}

\begin{GPTA}
 The ``sticks" you're referring to next to the alphabet are vertical bars used to denote the length or magnitu de of a line segment, vector, or sometimes for absolute value. In mathematics:

    - When used around a line segment, such as $|\overline{M N}|$, it indicates the length of the segment between p oints $M$ and $N$.

    - Similarly, $|\overline{Q R}|$ indicates the length of the segment between points $Q$ and $R$.

    - The absolute value of a number, such as $|x|$, represents its distance from zero on the number line, a lways yielding a non-negative result.
