\begin{GPTA}
The simple answer to the question of whether the lengths indicated by the notation $|\overline{A B}|$ are whole numb ers is: Not always.

    These lengths can be whole numbers, fractions, or irrational numbers (such as numbers involving square roots). In problems where a whole number is specifically needed, the calculated length is rounded to the nearest whole number as per the requirement.
    For example, in the problem provided, the length $|\overline{Q R}|$ was calculated to be 3.7865 m and then rounded to 4 m as the final answer.
