\begin{GPTA}
To find the area of $\triangle M Q R$ based on the information given:

1. Area of $\triangle M N R$ :

- Using the details provided, the area is calculated as:

$$
\text { Area of } \triangle M N R=\frac{1}{2} \times 15 \times 5 \sqrt{3}=\frac{75 \sqrt{3}}{2} \mathrm{~m}^2 \approx 64.9519 \mathrm{~m}^2
$$

2. Area of $\triangle M N Q$ :

- The calculated area of $\triangle M N Q$ is:

$$
\text { Area of } \triangle M N Q=\frac{1}{2} \times 15 \times 4.8738=36.5535 \mathrm{~m}^2
$$

3. Area of $\triangle M Q R$ :

- Subtract the area of $\triangle M N Q$ from the area of $\triangle M N R$ :

$$
\text { Area of } \triangle M Q R=64.9519-36.5535=28.3984 \mathrm{~m}^2
$$

4. Approximate the Solution:

- Rounded to the nearest whole number, the area of $\triangle M Q R$ is approximately $28 \mathrm{~m}^2$.

Thus, the answer to the problem, which is the area of $\triangle M Q R$, is approximately $28 \mathrm{~m}^2$. If you have furt her questions about these calculations or need additional assistance, feel free to ask!
