    What is definition of perimeter?  
\end{GPTQ}

\begin{GPTA}
 The perimeter of a polygon is the total distance around the edge of the polygon. It is calculated by addin g together the lengths of all its sides. For example, if you have a polygon with sides of lengths $a, b, c$, an $\mathrm{d} d$, the perimeter $P$ would be:
    
    $$
    P=a+b+c+d
    $$
    
    
    In the case of regular polygons (like squares), where all sides are equal, you can also calculate the perim eter by multiplying the length of one side by the total number of sides. For a square with side length $s$, th e perimeter $P$ would be:
    
    $$
    P=4 s
    $$
