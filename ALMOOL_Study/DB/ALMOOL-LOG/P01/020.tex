\begin{GPTQ}
    Can you tell me the triangle area formula?
\end{GPTQ}

\begin{GPTA}
Certainly! The area $A$ of a triangle can be calculated using the following formula:
    
    $$
    A=\frac{1}{2} \times \text { base } \times \text { height }
    $$
    
    
    Where:

    - The ``base" is the length of any one of the triangle's sides, typically taken as the bottom side.

    - The ``height" is the perpendicular distance from the base to the opposite vertex.
    
    For a right triangle, the legs can be used as the base and height. For other types of triangles, you may nee d to determine the height separately. Would you like to see how this formula is applied in an example?
