\begin{GPTQ}
    so that means that they are whole numbers?

\begin{GPTA}
Not necessarily. While the notation $|\overline{A B}|$ indicates the length of the line segment between points $A$ and $B$, the value could be a whole number or any other real number, depending on the problem context. In the problem you've described, some of these lengths are specifically asked to be approximated to the $n$ earest whole number, but the exact lengths themselves might be non-whole numbers. For example, $|\overline{Q R}|$ was calculated as 3.7865 m and then rounded to the nearest whole number, which gives 4 m.
