    I think its a trick question
\end{GPTQ}

\begin{GPTA}
It's possible that the question is designed to provide just enough information to challenge your understan ding of geometry and triangle properties. Here's a recap of what we've determined:

- The key part of the problem provided earlier was to find the measure of $\angle A E B$, which we calculated to be $60^{\circ}$.

- The problem might be testing your knowledge of the properties of circles and triangles, such as usi ng the sum of angles in a triangle and the external angles in relation to the intercepted arcs or chords.

- If you think there might be a trick or an overlooked element in the problem, revisiting all given information and double-checking any assumptions or interpretations could shed light on it.

If there are any other parts of the problem or details you're uncertain about, feel free to ask for clarificati on. Understanding the way these elements fit together is an excellent way to comprehend how geometric principles are applied.
