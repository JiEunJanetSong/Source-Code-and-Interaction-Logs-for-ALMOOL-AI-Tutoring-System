\begin{GPTQ}
    so should I think the ratio is $3: 1$ ?   
\end{GPTQ}

\begin{GPTA}
Yes, that's correct! The ratio of the bottom diameter to the top diameter is $3: 1$. This means if the top dia meter is represented as $d$, then the bottom diameter is $3 d$. Let me know if there's anything else you'd like to know!
