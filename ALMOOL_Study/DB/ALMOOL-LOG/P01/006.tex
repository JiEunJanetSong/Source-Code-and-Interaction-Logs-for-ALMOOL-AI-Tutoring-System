    What is the sphere volume formula?  
\end{GPTQ}

\begin{GPTA}
The volume of a sphere is given by the formula:
    
    $$
    V=\frac{4}{3} \pi r^3
    $$
    
    where:
    - $V$ is the volume of the sphere,
    - $\pi$ is a mathematical constant approximately equal to 3.14159,
    - $r$ is the radius of the sphere.
    
    This formula calculates the amount of three-dimensional space occupied by the sphere based on its radius.
