 Certainly! Let's break down the explanation for why choice C is correct.

    In the problem, we are given two triangles, $A B C$ and $D E F$, with:

    - Angles $B$ and $E$, both measuring $27^{\circ}$.

    - Angles $C$ and $F$, both measuring $41^{\circ}$.
    
    Since two pairs of corresponding angles are equal, this implies that triangles $A B C$ and $D E F$ are similar by the Angle-Angle (AA) similarity criterion. However, for two triangles to be congruent, they must be s imilar and have all corresponding sides equal in length.

    Therefore, an additional piece of information is needed to determine congruency, which involves compar ing the lengths of the corresponding sides of the triangles.

    The crucial step here is choosing which information helps us confirm congruency. Choice C suggests kn owing the lengths of sides $B C$ and $E F$. Since these sides correspond in the similar triangles, verifying t heir equality would confirm that the triangles are congruent. In congruent triangles, corresponding sides are equal in length, so this information is sufficient to establish congruency:

    $$
    B C=E F \Longrightarrow \triangle A B C \cong \triangle D E F
    $$
    
    
    Thus, knowing the lengths of $B C$ and $E F$ is sufficient to determine congruency, making choice C the co rrect answer.
