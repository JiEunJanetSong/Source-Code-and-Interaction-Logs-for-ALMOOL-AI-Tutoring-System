how can you show the relationship between the companies

\begin{GPTA}
To show the relationship between the number of shares Simone can purchase from Company A $(x)$ and Company B (y), we use a linear equation derived from the points on the graph and the given conditions.    

Steps to Form the Equation
1. Identify Points:
- You already have the points $(0,40)$ and $(60,0)$ from the graph. These are the intercepts of $t$ he line.
2. Calculate the Slope:
- The slope, $m$, between these two points is:

$$
m=\frac{0-40}{60-0}=\frac{-40}{60}=-\frac{2}{3}
$$

3. Form the Equation Using Point-Slope Form:
- The point-slope form of a line is given by:

$$
y-y_1=m\left(x-x_1\right)
$$


Use one of the points, say $(0,40)$, to form:

$$
y-40=-\frac{2}{3}(x-0)
$$

4. Simplify to Slope-Intercept Form:
- Convert to standard $y=m x+b$ form:

$$
y=-\frac{2}{3} x+40
$$

5. Convert to Standard Form:
- Multiply through by 3 to eliminate the fraction:

$$
3 y=-2 x+120
$$

6. Rearrange:
- Arrange terms to get $a x+b y=c$ form:

$$
2 x+3 y=120
$$


However, if we match it with the given options, the equivalent standard form that fits this is choice $\mathbf{B}$ : $8 x+12 y=480$, as dividing both sides by 4 gives an equivalent form proportional to $2 x+3 y=120$. This equation represents the relationship between the number of shares Simone can purchase from Comp any A and Company B.
