what is the $y$-intercept    
\end{GPTQ}

\begin{GPTA}
The $y$-intercept of a linear equation is the point where the line crosses the $y$-axis. This occurs when $x=0$.
    To find the $y$-intercept from the graph or from an equation, you can use the coordinates of the point wher $e$ the line intersects the $y$-axis.
    Example:
    From the graph we were discussing, which passes through the points $(0,40)$ and $(60,0)$, the $y$-intercept occurs at the point where $x=0$. Therefore, the $y$-intercept is at the point $(0,40)$.
    This means the $y$-intercept is 40 , and the line crosses the $y$-axis at $y=40$.
