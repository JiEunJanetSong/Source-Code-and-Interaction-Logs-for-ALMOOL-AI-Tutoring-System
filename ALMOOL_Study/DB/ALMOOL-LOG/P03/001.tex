How do you find the slope   
\end{GPTQ}

\begin{GPTA}
To find the slope of a line given two points, you can use the slope formula:
    
    $$
    m=\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}
    $$
    
    
    Here, $\left(x_1, y_1\right)$ and $\left(x_2, y_2\right)$ are the coordinates of the two points.
    Example:
    If the two points are $(0,40)$ and $(60,0)$, then:
    
    $$
    m=\frac{0-40}{60-0}=\frac{-40}{60}=\frac{-2}{3}
    $$
    
    
    So, the slope of the line is $-\frac{2}{3}$.
    This negative slope indicates that the line is decreasing as you move from left to right.
