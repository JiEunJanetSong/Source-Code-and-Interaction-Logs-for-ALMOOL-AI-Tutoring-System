The first step in solving the problem is to set up the equations for the time taken to travel upstream and d ownstream using the formula:
    
    $$
    \text { Distance }=\text { Rate } \times \text { Time }
    $$
    
    1. Determine the Rates:

    - Upstream, the effective rowing rate will be $x-1$, where $x$ is John's rowing rate in still wate $r$ because he rows against the $1 \mathrm{~km} / \mathrm{hr}$ current.

    - Downstream, the effective rowing rate will be $x+1$, as he benefits from the current's assistance.

    2. Set Up Time Equations:

    - For the upstream journey, the time, $u$, taken can be expressed as:
    
    $$
    u=\frac{16}{x-1}
    $$
    
    - For the downstream journey, the time, $t$, can be expressed as:
    
    $$
    t=\frac{16}{x+1}
    $$
    
    
    So the first step is to write these expressions for the times taken to travel each segment of the trip. Once t his is set up, you can combine these two time equations in the next step since the total journey took 4 hours.
