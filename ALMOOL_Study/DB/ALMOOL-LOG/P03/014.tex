\end{GPTQ}

\begin{GPTA}
The first step is to set the supply and demand equations equal to each other because we are looking for th e equilibrium point where supply equals demand. Specifically, you need to equate the two expressions fo r price:
    
    $$
    30-\text { Quantity }=10+3 \times \text { Quantity }
    $$
    
    
    This equation will allow you to solve for the quantity of lamps that need to be sold for supply and deman d to be equal.
