\end{GPTQ}

\begin{GPTA}
To find out which statement about $n$ is correct, we need to analyze the pattern given in the problem. 
    
    Let's go through the steps:

    1. Interpret the Table:

    - First, rewrite the table with the sums calculated:

\begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
        \hline$n$ & Pattern & Sum\\
        \hline 1 & 1 & 1\\
        \hline 2 & $1+3$ & 4\\
        \hline 3 & $1+3+5$ & 9\\
        \hline 4 & $1+3+5+7$ & 16\\
        \hline 5 & $1+3+5+7+9$ & 25\\
        \hline
        \end{tabular}
    \end{center}

    2. Analyze the Sums:

- Look at the 'Sum' column:

- $1=1^2$

- $4=2^2$

- $9=3^2$

- $16=4^2$

- $25=5^2$

3. Identify the Pattern:

- Each sum is the square of $n$.

4. Choose the Correct Statement:

- The statement that says ``The sum of the first $n$ odd numbers equals the square of $n$ " is correct.

Therefore, the correct answer is $\textbf {(C)}$ : The sum of the first $n$ odd numbers equals the square of $n$.
