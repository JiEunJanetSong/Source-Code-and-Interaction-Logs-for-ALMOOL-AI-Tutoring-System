\begin{GPTA}
    The answer to the problem is that John's rowing rate, independent of the current, is approximately 8.1 kil ometers per hour.

    Here's a brief recap of how we arrived at this answer:

    1. Equation Setup:

    - The equation for total time was:
    
    $$
    \frac{16}{x-1}+\frac{16}{x+1}=4
    $$
    
    2. Solve the Quadratic:

    - After clearing the fractions and simplifying, we obtained the quadratic equation:
    
    $$
    x^2-8 x-1=0
    $$
    
    3. Use the Quadratic Formula:

    - Plug into the quadratic formula:
    
    $$
    x=\frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4 a c}}{2 a}=\frac{8 \pm \sqrt{68}}{2}
    $$
    
    4. Evaluate the Solutions:

    - Simplify to find $x=4 \pm \sqrt{17}$.
    
    - The valid (positive) solution is:
    
    $$
    x=4+\sqrt{17} \approx 8.1
    $$
    
    
    Therefore, John rows at approximately 8.1 kilometers per hour in still water.
