\begin{GPTA}
    The next step is to solve the equation for the variable ``Quantity." After setting the supply and demand eq uations equal to each other, you have:

    $$
    30-\text { Quantity }=10+3 \times \text { Quantity }
    $$
    
    
    Now, perform the following steps:

    1. Combine like terms by moving all the terms involving ``Quantity" to one side of the equation:
    
    $$
    30-10=3 \times \text { Quantity }+ \text { Quantity }
    $$
    
    2. Simplify both sides:
    
    $$
    20=4 \times \text { Quantity }
    $$
    
    3. Solve for ``Quantity" by dividing both sides of the equation by 4 :
    
    Quantity $=5$

    This tells you that the business needs to sell 5 lamps to achieve equilibrium where supply equals demand
