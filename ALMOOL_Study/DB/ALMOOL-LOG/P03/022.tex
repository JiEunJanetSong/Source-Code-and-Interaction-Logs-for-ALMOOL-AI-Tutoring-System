    The next step is to combine the expressions for the upstream and downstream times because the total time for the journey is 4 hours. Use the following equation:
    
    $$
    \frac{16}{x-1}+\frac{16}{x+1}=4
    $$
    
    
    This equation states that the sum of the time taken upstream and the time taken downstream equals 4 hours.
    Now, to solve for $x$, you'll want to clear the fractions by finding a common denominator and solving the resulting equation.  
    
    1. Combine the fractions:

- The common denominator for the fractions is $(x-1)(x+1)$.

- Rewrite the equation by combining the fractions:

$$
\frac{16(x+1)+16(x-1)}{(x-1)(x+1)}=4
$$

2. Simplify and solve:

- Simplify the numerator and set the equation equal to 4 by multiplying both sides by the common denominator to clear the fraction:

$$
32 x=4\left(x^2-1\right)
$$

3. Rearrange and solve for $x$ 

- Simplify and rearrange the equation:

$$
4 x^2-32 x-4=0
$$

4. Solve the quadratic equation:

- Use the quadratic formula to find $x$ :

$$
x=\frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4 a c}}{2 a}
$$

where $a=4, b=-32$, and $c=-4$.

By solving this quadratic equation, you'll find the possible values for $x$, the rowing rate in still water. Sel ect the positive solution to get the final answer. If you need further assistance in solving this, let me know!
