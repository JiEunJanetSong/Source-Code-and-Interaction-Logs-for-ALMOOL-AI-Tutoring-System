\begin{GPTA}
The first step to solve this problem is to set up a proportion. Since the amount of flour scales directly wit h the number of cupcakes, you can compare the amount of flour needed for 6 cupcakes to the amount ne eded for 15 cupcakes. The proportion is:
    
    $$
    \frac{3 \text { cups of flour }}{6 \text { cupcakes }}=\frac{x \text { cups of flour }}{15 \text { cupcakes }}
    $$
    
    
    This proportion will help you find the value of $x$, which represents the cups of flour needed for 15 cupca kes.
