 Certainly! To simplify the expression $4 x^n+x^{4 n}$, the first step is to factor out the common term, $x^n$. The expression can be written as:
    
    $$
    4 x^n+x^{4 n}=x^n\left(4+x^{3 n}\right)
    $$
    
    
    This is the first step in simplifying the expression. From here, the expression inside the parentheses can $b$ e used as is, since no further simplification is possible.
