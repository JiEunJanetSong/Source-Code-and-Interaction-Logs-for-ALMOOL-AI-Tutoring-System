If a circle has the equation $(x-4)^2+(y-3)^2=36$, what is the shortest straight-line distance from the center of the circle to the origin?

}\SetValue{Solution}{%
Answer: $5$ 

Based on the general equation of a circle, $(x-h)^2+(y-k)^2=r^2$, the center point is $(h, k)$. For this circle, the center point is $(4,3)$. This point is a distance of 5 from the origin, which has the coordinates $(0,0)$. The graph of the circle is as follows:

        You can calculate the shortest straight-line distance by using the distance formula or, even easier, recognizing that these numbers form a Pythagorean triple: 3-4-5. Recognizing that this is a Pythagorean triple will save you the time and trouble of calculating the distance using the distance formula.
