Answer: \textbf{(B)}

We are given a recipe for 6 cupcakes that requires 3 cups of flour. We need to find out how much flour is needed for 15 cupcakes.

 Step 1: Set Up a Proportion
Since the amount of flour scales directly with the number of cupcakes, we set up the proportion:

$
\frac{3 \text{ cups of flour}}{6 \text{ cupcakes}} = \frac{x \text{ cups of flour}}{15 \text{ cupcakes}}
$

 Step 2: Solve for $x$
Cross multiply:

$
3 \times 15 = 6 \times x
$

$
45 = 6x
$

$
x = \frac{45}{6} = 7.5
$

 Step 3: Select the Correct Answer
The correct choice is $B) 7.5$.
