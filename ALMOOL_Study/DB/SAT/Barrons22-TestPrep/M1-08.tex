Marcus completely filled his truck's 14 -gallon gas tank. The computer at the gas pump indicates that Marcus spent $\$ 34$ in this transaction; the price per gallon was $\$ 3$. How many gallons of gas did Marcus have in his tank before he started to fill it?

}\SetValue{Solution}{%

Answer: $2.66$ or $2.67$ 

Marcus purchased $\$ 34$ of gas at $\$ 3$ a gallon. You can determine how many gallons of gas he purchased:

$
\frac{34}{3}=11.333=11.333
$


Then subtract 11.333 from the total capacity of the tank:

$
14-11.333 \approx 2.67
$

You can answer 2.66 or 2.67-the SAT will be fine if you round up or round down. Just be sure to fill out all the spots in the grid.
