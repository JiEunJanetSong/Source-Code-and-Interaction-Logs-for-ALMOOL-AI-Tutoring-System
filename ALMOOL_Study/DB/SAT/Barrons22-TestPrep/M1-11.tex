Answer: \textbf{(C)} 

To determine a $3 \%$ increase on an original amount of $x$, add $3 \%$ to the original amount:

$
x+0.03 x=1.03 x
$


You can save time if you recognize that you can simply multiply $x$ by 1.03 to determine the total of $x$ plus $3 \%$ interest. The amount in the account is compounded twice. So multiply $x$ by 1.03 twice:

$
x \cdot 1.03 \cdot 1.03=1.0609 x
$
