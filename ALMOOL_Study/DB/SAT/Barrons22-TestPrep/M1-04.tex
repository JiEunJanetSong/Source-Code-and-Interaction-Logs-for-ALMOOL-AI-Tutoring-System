The Asian carp has experienced a rapid growth by displacing other fish in the Mississippi River. A researcher gathered three yearly samples from a 500-meter length of the Upper Mississippi River to determine the population trend of the fish over a decade.

Answer: \textbf{(A)}

To determine the approximate slope of the best-fit line, we can estimate the rate of increase in the number of Asian carp over the given years.

 Step 1: Identify Key Points

From the graph:

\begin{itemize}
    \item In 1990, the number of carp is around 0.
    \item In 2000, the number of carp is around 38.
\end{itemize}

 Step 2: Calculate the Slope

The slope formula is:

$$
\text{slope} = \dfrac{\text{change in carp}}{\text{change in years}}
$$

$$
\text{slope} = \dfrac{38 - 0}{2000 - 1990} = \dfrac{38}{10} = 3.8
$$

 Step 3: Select the Closest Answer

The closest answer to 3.8 is 3.3.

Thus, the correct answer is:  

$\mathbf{A) \ 3.3}$
