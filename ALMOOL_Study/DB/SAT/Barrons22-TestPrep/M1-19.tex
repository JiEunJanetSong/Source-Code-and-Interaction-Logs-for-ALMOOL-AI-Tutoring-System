What is the value of the smallest side in a right triangle with a hypotenuse of 8 and angles of 30 and 60 degrees?

Answer: $4$

You can see what the side lengths are of this particular triangle in the drawing below:

        \end{center}
        You can easily calculate these side lengths because this is a 30-60-90 triangle. So the side lengths can be expressed as $x, \sqrt{3 x}$, and $2 x$. (This formula is provided at the beginning of the Math section.) The hypotenuse of 8 equals 2 x , and the shortest side equals $x$. Do the calculations to find the length of the shortest side:

        $
        \begin{gathered}
        8=2 x \\
        x=4
        \end{gathered}
        $
        
        
        Alternatively, you can just recognize that ratio of the smallest side to the hypotenuse in a 30-60-90 triangle is $1: 2$. So the value of the smallest side in a right triangle with a hypotenuse of 8 is 4 .
