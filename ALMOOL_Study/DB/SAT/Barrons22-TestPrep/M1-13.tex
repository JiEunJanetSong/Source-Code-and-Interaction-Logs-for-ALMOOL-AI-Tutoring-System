A lamp business uses the following equations to express supply and demand as a function of price and quantity for its lamps:
\begin{center}
    $\text{Supply: }\text{Price}=30-\text{Quantity}$
\end{center}
\begin{center}
    $\text{Demand: } \text{Price}=10+3 \times \text{Quantity}$
\end{center}


How many lamps does the business need to sell in order for the supply of lamps to equal the demand for lamps exactly-i.e., for the supply and demand to be at equilibrium?

}\SetValue{Solution}{%

Answer: $5$ 

Since the supply and demand are at equilibrium, set the two expressions equal to one another and solve for the number of lamps:

$
\begin{gathered}
30-\text { Quantity }=10+3 \times \text { Quantity } \\
20=4 \times \text { Quantity } \\
5=\text { Quantity }
\end{gathered}
$
