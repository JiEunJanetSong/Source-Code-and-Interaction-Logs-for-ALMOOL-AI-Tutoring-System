Andrew's sports car has a speedometer that shows a maximum value of 180 miles per hour. Given that there are approximately 1.61 kilometers in one mile, what would be the maximum value of his speedometer (to the nearest whole number) if it were listed in kilometers per hour?

}\SetValue{Solution}{%
Answer: \textbf{(C)} 

We are given that Andrew's speedometer shows a maximum of 180 miles per hour and that 1 mile ≈ 1.61 kilometers. We need to convert 180 miles per hour to kilometers per hour.

 Step 1: Convert Miles per Hour to Kilometers per Hour  
Using the conversion factor:

$
180 \times 1.61 = 289.8
$

 Step 2: Round to the Nearest Whole Number  
$
\text{Rounded } 289.8 \approx 290
$

 Step 3: Select the Correct Answer  
The correct choice is $C) 290$ km/hour.
