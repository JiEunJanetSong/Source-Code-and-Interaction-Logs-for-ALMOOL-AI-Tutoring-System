Which of the following equations properly expresses the functional relationship given by this expression?

``Take an input variable and divide it by 4; then subtract 5 from the result."

\ansFOURs{%start
f(x)=\dfrac{x-5}{4}}{%<--- (A)
f(x)=\dfrac{x}{4}-5}{%<--- (B)
f(x)=5-\dfrac{x}{4}}{%<--- (C)
f(x)=\dfrac{5-x}{4}}%<---- (D)

}\SetValue{Solution}{%
Answer: \textbf{(B)} 

When you are told, ``Take an input variable," that refers to $x$. Then divide the $x$ by 4 and subtract 5 from this, which gives the function $f(x)=\dfrac{x}{4}-5$.
}\SetValue{Answer}{%
B
