In the equation below, $F$ stands for gravitational force, $m_1$ and $m_2$ stand for the masses of two different objects, $G$ is a constant, and $d$ stands for the distance between the two objects. (Note that mass and distance must have positive values.)

$$
F=\dfrac{G \times m_1 \times m_2}{d^2}
$$

What would most minimize the gravitational force between objects 1 and 2 ?

Minimize $m_1 \times m_2$ and maximize $d$}{%<--- (C)
Maximize $d, \mathrm{~m}_1$, and $m_2$}%<---- (D)

}\SetValue{Solution}{%
Answer: \textbf{(C)} 

To minimize the overall gravitational force, the value of the numerator should be as small as possible, and the value of the denominator should be as large as possible. Out of the possible answers, choice (C) would best accomplish this. It would make the value of $m_1 \times m_2$ as small as possible and make the denominator $\mathrm{d}^2$ as large as possible.
