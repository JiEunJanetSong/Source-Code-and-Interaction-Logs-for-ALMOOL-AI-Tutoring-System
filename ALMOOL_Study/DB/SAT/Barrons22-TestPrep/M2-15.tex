If an amusement park worker measures three riders as being 48 inches, 56 inches, and 40 inches tall and the margin of error of each of the worker's measurements is $\pm 2$ inches, what is the possible range of the sum of the riders' actual heights in inches?

\ansFOURs{%start
48 \leq$ total height $\leq 144}{%<--- (A)
42 \leq$ total height $\leq 150}{%<--- (B)
138 \leq$ total height $\leq 150}{%<--- (C)
158 \leq$ total height $\leq 180}%<---- (D)

}\SetValue{Solution}{%
Answer: \textbf{(C)} 

Since there are three separate measurements that are each off by up to 2 units, you can determine the range of possible values by adding all the individual measurements together and then including a range of plus or minus 6:
    
 $
\begin{aligned}
48 + 56 + 40 &= 144 \\
144 + 6 &= 150 \\
144 - 6 &= 138
\end{aligned}
$
Choice (C) shows the correct range.
