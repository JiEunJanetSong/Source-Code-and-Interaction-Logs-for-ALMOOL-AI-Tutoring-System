A function never intersects the $y$-axis. Which of the following could be an equation of the function?

\ansFOURs{%start
y=2 x-5}{%<--- (A)
y=4}{%<--- (B)
x=36}{%<--- (C)
y=x}%<---- (D)

}\SetValue{Solution}{%
Answer: \textbf{(C)} 

$x=36$ does not have a $y$-intercept, because it runs parallel to the $y$-axis. Therefore, this equation never intersects the $y$-axis. Here is a graph of $x=$ 36:

        All of the other choices intersect the $y$-axis one time, because they have a $y$ value when $x=0$.
