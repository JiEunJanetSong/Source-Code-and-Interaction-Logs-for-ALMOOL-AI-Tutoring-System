A right triangle has a hypotenuse of 20 inches and another side length of 16 inches. What is the length of the third side of the right triangle in inches?

}\SetValue{Solution}{%
Answer: $12$
Use the Pythagorean Theorem, $a^2+b^2=c^2$, to solve for the unknown side. Use 20 for the $c$, because it is the hypotenuse. Use 16 for $a$, because it is one of the legs of the triangle (you could also use 16 for $b$ ). Solve for the unknown side as follows:

$
\begin{aligned}
a^2 + b^2 &= c^2 \\
\rightarrow 16^2 + b^2 &= 20^2 \\
\rightarrow 256 + b^2 &= 400 \\
\rightarrow b^2 &= 400 - 256 \\
\rightarrow b^2 &= 144 \\
\rightarrow b &= \sqrt{144} = 12
\end{aligned}
