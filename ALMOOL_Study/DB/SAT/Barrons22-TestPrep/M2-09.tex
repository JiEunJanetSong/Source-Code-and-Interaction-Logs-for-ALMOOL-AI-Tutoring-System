A librarian works at a constant pace, simultaneously shelving exactly 200 books in an hour and exactly 20 movies in an hour, and shelving only books and movies. If the librarian works for a total of $T$ hours, which expression shows the total number of items (books and movies) that the librarian shelves during that time?

Answer: \textbf{(A)} 

For each hour the librarian works, he or she shelves a total of 220 items. Therefore, the total number of items shelved during $T$ hours is $220 \times T$. The other answer choices have constants either added to or subtracted from the term multiplied by $T$. These answer choices would illogically mean that the librarian could shelve or remove items without spending any time at all doing so.
