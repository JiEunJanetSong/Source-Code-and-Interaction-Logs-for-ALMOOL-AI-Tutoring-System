}\SetValue{Solution}{%

From Example 2 we know that for any value of $c$, the function

$$
y=\frac{1+c e^t}{1-c e^t}
$$

is a solution of this differential equation. Substituting the values $t=0$ and $y=2$, we get

$$
2=\frac{1+c e^0}{1-c e^0}=\frac{1+c}{1-c}
$$


Solving this equation for $c$, we get $2-2 c=1+c$, which gives $c=\frac{1}{3}$. So the solution of the initial-value problem is

$$
y=\frac{1+\frac{1}{3} e^t}{1-\frac{1}{3} e^t}=\frac{3+e^t}{3-e^t}
$$


The graph of the solution is shown in Figure 6. The curve is the one member of the family of solution curves from Figure 5 that passes through the point $(0,2)$.
