}\SetValue{Solution}{%

This sequence is defined recursively, where each term after the first two is found by subtracting the term before the previous one from the previous term.

We are given:

 $a_1 = 2$

 $a_2 = 1$

 The rule: $a_{n+1} = a_n - a_{n-1}$ (This rule applies for $n \ge 2$)

Let's find the first five terms:

1.  a₁: Given directly.

    $$a_1 = 2$$

2.  a₂: Given directly.

    $$a_2 = 1$$

3.  a₃: Use the recursive formula with $n=2$.

    $$a_3 = a_{2+1} = a_2 - a_{2-1} = a_2 - a_1 = 1 - 2 = -1$$

4.  a₄: Use the recursive formula with $n=3$.

    $$a_4 = a_{3+1} = a_3 - a_{3-1} = a_3 - a_2 = -1 - 1 = -2$$

5.  a₅: Use the recursive formula with $n=4$.

    $$a_5 = a_{4+1} = a_4 - a_{4-1} = a_4 - a_3 = -2 - (-1) = -2 + 1 = -1$$

The first five terms of the sequence are:

$$2, 1, -1, -2, -1$$
