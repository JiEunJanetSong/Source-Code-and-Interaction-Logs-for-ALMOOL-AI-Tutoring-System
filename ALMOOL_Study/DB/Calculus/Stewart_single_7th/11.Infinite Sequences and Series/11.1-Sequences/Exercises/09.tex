}\SetValue{Solution}{%

This sequence is defined recursively. This means the first term is given, and subsequent terms are found using the previous term(s).

We are given:

 The first term: $a_1 = 1$

 The rule to find the next term from the current term: $a_{n+1} = 5a_n - 3$

Let's find the first five terms:

1.  a₁: This is given directly.

    $$a_1 = 1$$

2.  a₂: Use the recursive formula with $n=1$.

    $$a_2 = a_{1+1} = 5a_1 - 3 = 5(1) - 3 = 5 - 3 = 2$$

3.  a₃: Use the recursive formula with $n=2$.

    $$a_3 = a_{2+1} = 5a_2 - 3 = 5(2) - 3 = 10 - 3 = 7$$

4.  a₄: Use the recursive formula with $n=3$.

    $$a_4 = a_{3+1} = 5a_3 - 3 = 5(7) - 3 = 35 - 3 = 32$$

5.  a₅: Use the recursive formula with $n=4$.

    $$a_5 = a_{4+1} = 5a_4 - 3 = 5(32) - 3 = 160 - 3 = 157$$

The first five terms of the sequence are:

$$1, 2, 7, 32, 157$$
