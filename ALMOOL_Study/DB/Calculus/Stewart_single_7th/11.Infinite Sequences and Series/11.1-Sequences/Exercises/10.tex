}\SetValue{Solution}{%

This sequence is defined recursively. We are given the first term and a rule to find the next term using the previous term and the index $n$.

The definition is:

 $a_1 = 6$

 $a_{n+1} = \frac{a_n}{n}$

Let's find the first five terms:

1.  a₁: This is given directly.

    $$a_1 = 6$$

2.  a₂: To find $a_2$, we use the formula with $n=1$.

    $$a_2 = a_{1+1} = \frac{a_1}{1} = \frac{6}{1} = 6$$

3.  a₃: To find $a_3$, we use the formula with $n=2$.

    $$a_3 = a_{2+1} = \frac{a_2}{2} = \frac{6}{2} = 3$$

4.  a₄: To find $a_4$, we use the formula with $n=3$.

    $$a_4 = a_{3+1} = \frac{a_3}{3} = \frac{3}{3} = 1$$

5.  a₅: To find $a_5$, we use the formula with $n=4$.

    $$a_5 = a_{4+1} = \frac{a_4}{4} = \frac{1}{4}$$

The first five terms of the sequence are:

$$6, 6, 3, 1, \frac{1}{4}$$
