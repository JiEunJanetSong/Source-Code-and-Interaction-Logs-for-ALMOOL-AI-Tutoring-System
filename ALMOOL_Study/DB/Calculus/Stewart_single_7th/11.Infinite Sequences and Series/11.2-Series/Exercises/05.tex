Calculate the first eight terms of the sequence of partial sums correct to four decimal places. Does it appear that the series is convergent or divergent?

$$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \dfrac{1}{n^3}$$

}\SetValue{Solution}{%

The given series is

$$
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \dfrac{1}{n^3}
$$


First we calculate $a_n$ and $s_n$. The table shows that as we add more and more terms, these partial sums become closer and closer to 1.2020 . We know that if the sequence $s_n$ is convergent and $\lim _{n \rightarrow \infty} s_n=s$ exists as a real number, then the series an is called convergent. Hence the given series $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \dfrac{1}{n^3}$ is convergent.

Hence the given series $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \dfrac{1}{n^3}$ is convergent.
