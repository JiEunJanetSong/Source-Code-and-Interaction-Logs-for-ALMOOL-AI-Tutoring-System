Find at least 10 partial sums of the series. Graph both the sequence of terms and the sequence of partial sums on the same screen. Does it appear that the series is convergent or divergent? If it is convergent, find the sum. If it is divergent, explain why.

$$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \cos n$$

Here are the first 10 partial sums of the series:

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline & $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \cos (n)$ \\
\hline $n$ & Partial Sum $s_n$ (rounded) \\
\hline 1 & 0.540302 \\
\hline 2 & 0.124155 \\
\hline 3 & -0.865837 \\
\hline 4 & -1.519481 \\
\hline 5 & -1.235818 \\
\hline 6 & -0.275648 \\
\hline 7 & 0.478254 \\
\hline 8 & 0.332754 \\
\hline 9 & -0.578376 \\
\hline 10 & -1.417448 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

Observation from the graph:

- The terms $\cos (n)$ do not approach zero. They continue to oscillate between roughly -1 and 1.

- The partial sums fluctuate erratically without settling to a single value or leveling off.

Convergence Test:

A necessary condition for the convergence of an infinite series $\sum a_n$ is that the terms $a_n \rightarrow 0$ as $n \rightarrow \infty$.
Since $\cos (n)$ does not approach zero and instead oscillates, the series diverges.

Final Answer:

- The series $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \cos (n)$ is divergent.

- Reason: The terms do not tend to zero and the partial sums do not stabilize.
