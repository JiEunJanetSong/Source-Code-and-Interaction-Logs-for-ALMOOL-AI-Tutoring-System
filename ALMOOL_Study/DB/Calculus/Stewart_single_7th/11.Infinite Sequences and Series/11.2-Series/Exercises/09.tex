Find at least 10 partial sums of the series. Graph both the sequence of terms and the sequence of partial sums on the same screen. Does it appear that the series is convergent or divergent? If it is convergent, find the sum. If it is divergent, explain why.

$$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \dfrac{12}{(-5)^n}$$

Does it converge?

Yes, the partial sums approach -2, getting closer with each term. This is a convergent geometric series with:

- First term: $a=\dfrac{12}{(-5)^1}=-\dfrac{12}{5}$

- Common ratio: $r=\dfrac{1}{-5}$

Since $|r|<1$, the series converges. The sum of an infinite geometric series is:

$$
S=\dfrac{a}{1-r}=\dfrac{-\dfrac{12}{5}}{1-\left(-\dfrac{1}{5}\right)}=\dfrac{-\dfrac{12}{5}}{1+\dfrac{1}{5}}=\dfrac{-\dfrac{12}{5}}{\dfrac{6}{5}}=-2
$$


Final Answer:

- The series converges.

- The sum is $-2$.
