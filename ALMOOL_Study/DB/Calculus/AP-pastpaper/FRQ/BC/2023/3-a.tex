A bottle of milk is taken out of a refrigerator and placed in a pan of hot water to be warmed. The increasing function $M$ models the temperature of the milk at time $t$, where $M(t)$ is measured in degrees Celsius $\left({ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)$ and $t$ is the number of minutes since the bottle was placed in the pan. $M$ satisfies the differential equation $\frac{d M}{d t}=\frac{1}{4}(40-M)$. At time $t=0$, the temperature of the milk is $5^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. It can be shown that $M(t)<40$ for all values of $t$.

(a) A slope field for the differential equation $\frac{d M}{d t}=\frac{1}{4}(40-M)$ is shown. Sketch the solution curve through the point $(0,5)$.

# General Scoring Notes

The model solution is presented using standard mathematical notation.

Answers (numeric or algebraic) need not be simplified. Answers given as a decimal approximation should be correct to three places after the decimal point. Within each individual free-response question, at most one point is not earned for inappropriate rounding.

        \end{center}
        - solution curve; 1 point

## Scoring notes (a)

- The solution curve must pass through the point $(0,5)$, extend reasonably close to the left and right edges of the rectangle, and have no obvious conflicts with the given slope lines.

- Only portions of the solution curve within the given slope field are considered.

- The solution curve must lie entirely below the horizontal line segments at $M=40$.

Total for part (a) 1 point
