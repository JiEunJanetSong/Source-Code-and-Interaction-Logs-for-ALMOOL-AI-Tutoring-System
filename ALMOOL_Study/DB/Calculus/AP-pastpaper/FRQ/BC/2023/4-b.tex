The function $f$ is defined on the closed interval $[-2,8]$ and satisfies $f(2)=1$. The graph of $f^{\prime}$, the derivative of $f$, consists of two line segments and a semicircle, as shown in the figure.

(b) On what open intervals, if any, is the graph of $f$ concave down? Give a reason for your answer.

The graph of $f$ is concave down on $(-2,0)$ and $(4,6)$ because $f^{\prime}$ is decreasing on these intervals.

# General Scoring Notes

The model solution is presented using standard mathematical notation.

Answers (numeric or algebraic) need not be simplified. Answers given as a decimal approximation should be correct to three places after the decimal point. Within each individual free-response question, at most one point is not earned for inappropriate rounding.

The function $f$ is defined on the closed interval $[-2,8]$ and satisfies $f(2)=1$. The graph of $f^{\prime}$, the derivative of $f$, consists of two line segments and a semicircle, as shown in the figure.

## Model Solution (b)

The graph of $f$ is concave down on $(-2,0)$ and $(4,6)$ because $f^{\prime}$ is decreasing on these intervals.

## Scoring (b)

- For ``The graph of $f$ is concave down on $(-2,0)$ and $(4,6)$''
        - Intervals ; 1 point

- For ``because $f^{\prime}$ is decreasing on these intervals.''
        - Reason ; 1 point

## Scoring notes (b)

- The first point is earned only by an answer of $(-2,0)$ and $(4,6)$, or these intervals including one or both endpoints.

- A response must earn the first point to be eligible
 for second point.

- To earn the second point a response must correctly discuss the behavior of $f^{\prime}$ or the slopes of $f^{\prime}$.

- Special case: A response that presents exactly one of the two correct intervals with a correct reason earns 1 out of 2 points.

Total for part (b) 2 points
