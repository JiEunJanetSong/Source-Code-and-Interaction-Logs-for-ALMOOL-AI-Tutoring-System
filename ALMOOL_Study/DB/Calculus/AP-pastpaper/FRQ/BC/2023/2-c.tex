For $0 \leq t \leq \pi$, a particle is moving along the curve shown so that its position at time $t$ is $(x(t), y(t))$, where $x(t)$ is not explicitly given and $y(t)=2 \sin t$. It is known that $\frac{d x}{d t}=e^{\cos t}$. At time $t=0$, the particle is at position (1,0).

(c) Find the slope of the line tangent to the path of the particle at time $t=1$. Find the $x$-coordinate of the position of the particle at time $t=1$. Show the work that leads to your answers.

# General Scoring Notes

The model solution is presented using standard mathematical notation.

Answers (numeric or algebraic) need not be simplified. Answers given as a decimal approximation should be correct to three places after the decimal point. Within each individual free-response question, at most one point is not earned for inappropriate rounding.

## Model Solution (c)

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \frac{d y}{d x}=\frac{d y / d t}{d x / d t}=\frac{2 \cos t}{e^{\cos t}} \\
& \left.\frac{d y}{d x}\right|_{t=1}=\frac{2 \cos 1}{e^{\cos 1}}=0.629530
\end{aligned}
$$


The slope of the line tangent to the curve at $t=1$ is 0.630 (or 0.629).

$$
x(1)=x(0)+\int_0^1 \frac{d x}{d t} d t=1+\int_0^1 e^{\cos t} d t=3.341575
$$


The $x$-coordinate of the position at $t=1$ is 3.342 (or 3.341).

## Scoring (c)

- For $$
\begin{aligned}
& \frac{d y}{d x}=\frac{d y / d t}{d x / d t}=\frac{2 \cos t}{e^{\cos t}} \\
& \left.\frac{d y}{d x}\right|_{t=1}=\frac{2 \cos 1}{e^{\cos 1}}=0.629530
\end{aligned}
$$

The slope of the line tangent to the curve at $t=1$ is 0.630 (or 0.629).
    - Slope with supporting work; 1 point

- For $x(1)=x(0)+\int_0^1 \frac{d x}{d t} d t=1+\int_0^1 e^{\cos t} d t=3.341575$
    - $\int_0^1 e^{\cos t} d t$; 1 point

- For $x(1)=3.341575$ or $3.342$ or $3.341$
    - $x(1)$; 1 point

## Scoring notes (c)

- To earn the first point, the response must communicate $\frac{d y}{d x}=\frac{d y / d t}{d x / d t}$; for example:
    - $\frac{d y}{d x}=\frac{2 \cos 1}{e^{\cos 1}}$
    - $\frac{d y / d t}{d x / d t}=0.63$
    - $x^{\prime}(1)=1.716526, y^{\prime}(1)=1.080605$, slope $=0.63$
    - $\frac{d y}{d t}=2 \cos t$, slope $=0.63$

- A response may import an incorrect expression for $y^{\prime}(t)$ or value of $y^{\prime}(1)$ from part (a), provided it was declared in part (a).

- The second point is earned for a response that presents the definite integral $\int_0^1 e^{\cos t} d t$ or $\int_0^1 \frac{d x}{d t} d t$ with or without the initial condition.

- For the second point, if the differential is missing:
    - $\int_0^1 e^{\cos t}$ earns the second point and is eligible for the third point.

    - $x(1)=\int_0^1 e^{\cos t}$ earns the second point but is not eligible for the third point.

    - $x(1)=1+\int_0^1 e^{\cos t}$ earns the second point and is eligible for the third point.

    - $x(1)=\int_0^1 e^{\cos t}+1$ does not earn the second point but earns the third point for the correct answer.

- The third point is not earned for a response that presents an incorrect statement, such as

$$
x(1)=\int_0^1 e^{\cos t} d t=1+2.342
$$

- Degree mode: In degree mode, $\frac{d y}{d x}=0.735759$ or 0.012841 and $1+\int_0^1 e^{\cos t} d t=3.718144$.

Total for part (c) 3 points
