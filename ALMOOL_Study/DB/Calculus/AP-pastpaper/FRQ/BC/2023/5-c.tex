The graphs of the functions $f$ and $g$ are shown in the figure for $0 \leq x \leq 3$. It is known that $g(x)=\frac{12}{3+x}$ for $x \geq 0$. The twice-differentiable function $f$, which is not explicitly given, satisfies $f(3)=2$ and $\int_0^3 f(x) d x=10$.
        
(c) Let $h$ be the function defined by $h(x)=x \cdot f^{\prime}(x)$. Find the value of $\int_0^3 h(x) d x$.

}\SetValue{Solution}{%

Using integration by parts,

$$
\begin{array}{ll}
u=x & d v=f^{\prime}(x) d x \\
d u=d x & v=f(x)
\end{array}
$$

$\int h(x) d x=\int x \cdot f^{\prime}(x) d x=x \cdot f(x)-\int f(x) d x$

$\begin{aligned} \int_0^3 h(x) d x & =\int_0^3 x \cdot f^{\prime}(x) d x=\left.x \cdot f(x)\right|_0 ^3-\int_0^3 f(x) d x \\ & =(3 \cdot f(3)-0 \cdot f(0))-10=3 \cdot 2-0-10=-4\end{aligned}$

# General Scoring Notes

The model solution is presented using standard mathematical notation.
Answers (numeric or algebraic) need not be simplified. Answers given as a decimal approximation should be correct to three places after the decimal point. Within each individual free-response question, at most one point is not earned for inappropriate rounding.

## Model Solution (c)

Using integration by parts,

$$
\begin{array}{ll}
u=x & d v=f^{\prime}(x) d x \\
d u=d x & v=f(x)
\end{array}
$$

$\int h(x) d x=\int x \cdot f^{\prime}(x) d x=x \cdot f(x)-\int f(x) d x$

$\begin{aligned} \int_0^3 h(x) d x & =\int_0^3 x \cdot f^{\prime}(x) d x=\left.x \cdot f(x)\right|_0 ^3-\int_0^3 f(x) d x \\ & =(3 \cdot f(3)-0 \cdot f(0))-10=3 \cdot 2-0-10=-4\end{aligned}$

## Scoring (c)

Using integration by parts,

- For $$
\begin{array}{ll}
u=x & d v=f^{\prime}(x) d x \\
d u=d x & v=f(x)
\end{array}
$$
    - $u$ and $dv$; 1 point

- For $\int h(x) d x=\int x \cdot f^{\prime}(x) d x=x \cdot f(x)-\int f(x) d x$
    - $\int h(x) d x =x \cdot f(x)-\int f(x) d x$; 1 point

- For $-4$
    - Answer; 1 point
        
## Scoring notes (c)

- The first and second points are earned with an implied $u$ and $d v$ in the presence of

$$
x \cdot f(x)-\int f(x) d x \text { or }\left.x \cdot f(x)\right|_0 ^3-10
$$

- Limits of integration may be present, omitted, or partially present in the work for the first and second points.

- The tabular method may be used to show integration by parts. In this case, the first point is earned by having columns (labeled or unlabeled) that begin with $x$ and $f^{\prime}(x)$. The second point is earned for $x \cdot f(x)-\int f(x) d x$.

- The third point is earned only for the correct answer and can only be earned if the first 2 points were earned.

Total for part (c) 3 points
