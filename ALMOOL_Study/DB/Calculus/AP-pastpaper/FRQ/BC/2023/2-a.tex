For $0 \leq t \leq \pi$, a particle is moving along the curve shown so that its position at time $t$ is $(x(t), y(t))$, where $x(t)$ is not explicitly given and $y(t)=2 \sin t$. It is known that $\frac{d x}{d t}=e^{\cos t}$. At time $t=0$, the particle is at position (1,0).

(a) Find the acceleration vector of the particle at time $t=1$. Show the setup for your calculations.

# General Scoring Notes

The model solution is presented using standard mathematical notation.

Answers (numeric or algebraic) need not be simplified. Answers given as a decimal approximation should be correct to three places after the decimal point. Within each individual free-response question, at most one point is not earned for inappropriate rounding.

## Model Solution (a)

$$
x^{\prime \prime}(1)=\left.\frac{d}{d t}\left(e^{\cos t}\right)\right|_{t=1}=-1.444407
$$


$$
\begin{aligned}
& y(t)=2 \sin t \Rightarrow y^{\prime}(t)=2 \cos t \\
& y^{\prime \prime}(1)=\left.\frac{d}{d t}(2 \cos t)\right|_{t=1}=-1.682942
\end{aligned}
$$


The acceleration vector at time $t=1$ is $a(1)=\langle-1.444,-1.683($ or -1.682$)\rangle$.

## Scoring (a)

- For $x^{\prime \prime}(1)=\left.\frac{d}{d t}\left(e^{\cos t}\right)\right|_{t=1}=-1.444407$
    - $x^{\prime \prime}(1)$ with setup; 1 point

- For 
$$
\begin{aligned}
& y(t)=2 \sin t \Rightarrow y^{\prime}(t)=2 \cos t \\
& y^{\prime \prime}(1)=\left.\frac{d}{d t}(2 \cos t)\right|_{t=1}=-1.682942
\end{aligned}
$$
    - $y^{\prime \prime}(1)$ with setup; 1 point

## Scoring notes (a)

- The exact answer is $\left\langle x^{\prime \prime}(1), y^{\prime \prime}(1)\right\rangle=\left\langle-e^{\cos 1} \sin 1,-2 \sin 1\right\rangle$.

- $\left\langle-e^{\cos t} \sin t,-2 \sin t\right\rangle$ together with an incorrect or missing evaluation at $t=1$ earns 1 of the 2 points.

- A response of $\left\langle-e^{\cos t} \sin t,-2 \sin t\right\rangle=\left\langle-e^{\cos 1} \sin 1,-2 \sin 1\right\rangle$ or equivalent earns only 1 of the 2 points because it equates an expression to a numerical value.

- An unsupported correct acceleration vector carns 1 of the 2 points.

- The acceleration vector may be presented with other symbols, for example (.) or [, ].

- The components may be listed separately, as long as they are labeled.

- Degree mode: A response that presents answers obtained by using a calculator in degree mode does not earn the first point it would have otherwise earned. The response is generally eligible for all subsequent points (unless no answer is possible in degree mode or the question is made simpler by using degree mode). In degree mode, $x^{\prime \prime}(1)=-0.000828$ or -0.047433 and $y^{\prime \prime}(1)=-0.000609$ or -0.034905. A response that presents one of these values with correct setups earns 1 of the 2 points.

Total for part (a) 2 points
