The depth of seawater at a location can be modeled by the function $H$ that satisfies the differential equation $\frac{d H}{d t}=\frac{1}{2}(H-1) \cos \left(\frac{t}{2}\right)$, where $H(t)$ is measured in feet and $t$ is measured in hours after noon $(t=0)$. It is known that $H(0)=4$.

(a) A portion of the slope field for the differential equation is provided. Sketch the solution curve, $y=H(t)$, through the point $(0,4)$.

# General Scoring Notes

The model solution is presented using standard mathematical notation.

Answers (numeric or algebraic) need not be simplified. Answers given as a decimal approximation should be correct to three places after the decimal point. Within each individual free-response question, at most one point is not earned for inappropriate rounding.

    Sketch the solution curve, $y=H(t)$, y-intercept $(0,4)$.
    - Solution curve; 1  point

## Scoring notes (a)

- The solution curve must pass through the point $(0,4)$, extend to at least $t=4.5$, and have no obvious conflicts with the given slope lines.

- Only portions of the solution curve within the given slope field are considered.

Total for part (a) 1 point
